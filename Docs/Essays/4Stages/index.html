<p class="MessageBox">My apologies to <b>William Henry Jackson</b> re Fig. 1. He did the best that was possible with the equipment available at the time, and was justly famous for having done so. I'd appreciate it if anyone reading this would <b>send me</b> an appropriate picture to replace Fig. 1 with  from his/her earliest days with a camera at the Grand Canyon, Eiffel Tower, or similar spectacle.</p>

<p>The above is meant to convey a point, not to be turned into a rigid prescription. For example: an abstract painting might illustrate any level of excellence yet fall within none of the above categories. The main point I'm trying to convey is that great/beautiful pictures don't depend on awesome subject matter. Especially among amateur photographers, there is this persistent misconception that one needs to travel to some spectacular location to create a spectacular photograph.</p>

<p>Later, the same photographer may discover he or she can take a spectacular picture by photographing a less spectacular scene but in spectacular circumstances, such as a local lake at sunset. Occasionally and after years of maturation, a dedicated photographer may finally realize that neither spectacular subject matter nor spectacular circumstances are needed to create excellent art. Unfortunately, at this point he will leave 99% of his audience behind, and any sales/recognition he may formerly have enjoyed will likely plummet.</p>

<p>Strangely, this is a point that doesn't need to be made to even amateur painters. We've all seen someone with a portable easel and paint box busy painting a farmer's field and barn or a quiet pond in mid-morning light. Yet even then, the public is more likely to buy a painting of a snow leopard on a mountainside or Mt Fuji at sunrise.</p>
