<p>Although we considered whether a photograph could have the poetry and grace of certain paintings in <a href="pg4.html">Part 4</a>, there is a deeper question of whether photography should even be considered to be an art form. The underlying assumption we may have when asking this question is that the word &quot;art&quot; means hand-made, imaginative, and beautiful. But these assumptions are no longer made in the world of painting, so why should they be made in the world of photography?

<p>Photographs can be roughly grouped into two categories: documentation and art. Documentary photographs include CSI evidence, photojournalism, eBay product shots, and your family snapshots. The basic idea is to accurately record a scene for the historical record. Art photographs get created when the photographer's main purpose is along the lines of decoration, beauty, or self-expression. There is a tremendous amount of overlap: Photojournalists get awards in part because their images are well-composed and dramatically lit. Commercial photographers often earn their bread and butter by prettifying their subject matter. Landscape art photographers often pride themselves on how little they alter their photographs.
