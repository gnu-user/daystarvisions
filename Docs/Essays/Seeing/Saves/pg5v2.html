<H1>The Art of Seeing Art<br>Part 5: Toolbox</H1>
<P CLASS=SmallNoteCentered>Version 1.0, &copy; 2007 by Dale Cotton, all rights reserved

<p>The architect has certain fundamental principles for designing a building. An mechanical engineer has certain fundamental principles for designing a machine. Similarly, the visual artist has a powerful toolbox for building a picture. Part of appreciating art is recognizing what tools are in the artist's box and knowing a bit about how they work.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 1: 180-05a</a>

<h2>Tool 1: framing</h2>

<p>Fig. 1 is almost brutally simple but will at least serve to illustrate the points I want to make (I would have preferred not to use one of my own pictures, but was unable to find an appropriate composition without copyright restrictions). Fig. 1 shows a scene in Ste Anne de Beaupre, Quebec, near the St Lawrence Seaway. If you had been standing beside me when I took this photo, you would have seen a neigbouring yard to the left, a farm house to the right, more sky above, etc. In other words, Fig. 1 shows only a fraction of the entire vista that was before me.

<p>Ste Anne de Beaupre is a potential tourist destination, and if a non-artist tourist had stopped at the same location with her camera, she might conceivably have taken a picture there. Similarly, if a painter with portable easel and paintbox had passed that way, she might also have set up to sketch or paint there. The chances of either of them choosing the same rectangular segment of the scene that I chose is very small. Either might have filled her frame entirely with the barn, or even just part of the barn.

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="BarnVariations-sz600x250.jpg" width=600 height=250 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 2: 180-05, versions 2 and 3

<p>The non-artist is most likely to take a picture of the barn. The artist is most likely to make a picture with a barn in it. The barn was constructed in what I presume is a French or native-Quebec architectural style that few North Americans will have seen. That would be its attraction to the casual tourist, while its somewhat dilapidated state of repair together with the less than clear blue sky would be arguments against it. In direct contrast, an artist would see the barn as a source of rich textures and emotional connotations, but would then have to decide whether to make those qualities the subject of the picture or widen her view to take in the surroundings.

<h2>Tool 2: composition</h2>

<p>Putting a road, path, or river in a picture is a common compositional device in representational art. It beckons the viewer "into" the picture, encouraging her to take part in the little world within the frame, rather than to remain standing outside it. In "reality" the stretch of gravel drive in Fig. 1 is a long s-curve, perhaps twenty feet wide by two hundred feet long. We "know" that it is twenty feet wide at the bottom right of the picture and twenty feet wide at the middle of the picture where it disappears from view. But what is <b>actually</b> there in the picture is a vaguely triangular splotch of dark greys that might be several inches on a side, depending on the dimensions of the picture.

<p>As I mentioned in Part 3 the non-artist tends to look <b>through</b> a representational picture to be taken in by the illusion of visual "reality" it suggests. But the success of the picture has at least as much to do with how the artist arranges areas of colour on a simple flat rectangular surface. Some arrangements are weak and some are strong; some are energetic and some are lethargic; some are pleasing and some are jarring. The art of arranging areas of colour is called composition or design; and you can read more about it <a href="">here</a>.

<p>But just to give you a rough idea, let's look again at the scene in Fig. 1. Structurally, the barn roof and driveway interact due to their both having definite shapes and dark grey colour. The sky and field divide the rest of the image area in half:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 3: 180-05, rhymes

<p>The critical element of composition is energy. Since your eyes cannot take in everything that goes on in a picture all at once, there tends to be a path your attention will take when examining a picture. We can see that path for Fig. 1 shown here:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="180-05a-comp2-sz400x267.jpg" width=400 height=267 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 4: 180-05, flow of attention

<p class=Notebox>One of the most useful things you can do when viewing representational art is to ignore the illusion of depth and instead look at the picture as the two-dimensional rectangle it actually is. Take a moment to consider how the artist has arranged shapes, colours, and textures within that rectangle.

<h2>Tool 3: colour</h2>

<p>But colour itself is a critical tool in the visual artist's toolbox. Every hue invokes a different emotional response. There is enough similarity between the emotional response of different people that certain patterns have been noted. Yellows, oranges, and reds are called warm colours (presumably because of their association with flame). Most people find warm colours to be inviting and cheery.  Blues and greens are called cool colours and tend to invoke a calm response and to stay in the background. White, black, and shades of grey are neutral; tans and browns, slightly warm.

<p>Click on the following button and note your response to the different colours that appear:

<p>This bit of JavaScript magic by David Taylor of Clackamas Oregon fills the rectangle with randomly generated colours. To me, in general the lighter colours are lively and darker are somber; the warm colours are cheery and the cool colours wistful, just as theory suggests &ndash; but of course each particular colour has its unique feeling tone.

<p>If we look again at Fig. 1, the sky is a mix of cool colour (blues) and neutral colours (greys); the driveway is neutral (dark grey), as is the barn (off-whites and black). The field is the only source of warm colours, although even it is more cool (dark green) than warm. Yet the barn, at least to me, catches the eye first, in spite of its neutral colours. This is because of its strong simple shape together with the strong contrast betwen the off-white of the siding and the darks of the roof, windows, and doors.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 5: 180-05, increased saturation

<p>In Fig. 5 I've modified the original picture by increasing the saturation or vividness in the warm colours in the field and the blues of the sky. (Technically, saturation means the degree to which a given colour approaches purity.) We tend to find saturated colours more appealing in the same way that a child prefers to eat candy over cauliflower, but increased saturation also tends to turn up the emotional volume, which is why Van Gogh increasingly pushed his colours to the max.

<h2>Tool 4: contrast</h2>

<p>Contrast is technically an aspect of colour; but it's useful to treat it separately. The word contrast refers to a distinction between extremes of any aspect, but in visual art it is most often used as shorthand for a contrast in brightness. In Fig. 6 I've cranked up the contrast by making the darks darker and the lights, lighter:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: 180-05, increased contrast

<p>Increasing contrast generally adds drama; like saturation it offers another way to increase vividness.

<p>If we turn up the volume on both saturation and contrast, we get something along the lines of Fig. 7:

<h2>Tool 5: perspective</h2>

<p>Perspective refers to the set of rules for creating the illusion of three-dimensional depth on a two-dimensional surface, as in
