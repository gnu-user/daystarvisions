<h1>Composition in the Field for the Art Photographer</h1>
<P CLASS=SmallNoteCentered>Version 1.1, Page 1, &copy;2001 by Dale Cotton, all rights reserved

<p CLASS=SimpleIvoryBox>Note: This document is a follow-up companion to <a href="../Comp/pg1.html">Lessons in Composition for the Art Photographer</a>. It's primarily directed towards landscape photography, which is what I know best, although many concepts translate into other genres.

<h2>Aesthetic Instincts</h2>

<p>Now that you've had a bit of sink-or-swim exposure to the theoretical side of composition you may be thinking: "That's all very well on paper, but what good does it do me when I'm out on a shoot with my camera?" - Well, that's the subject of <I>this</I> tutorial.

<p>At one's leisure one can sit down and analyse a picture in any amount of detail - according to the principles explained in my composition tutorial or any others. But - in the field, through the puny finder of your camera with often only seconds to prepare before the lighting or other factors change - that leisure isn't often there. The solution is twofold:

<ol>
<li>Shoot several shots from as many different angles, etc., as time allows.
<li>Rely on your finely-honed aesthetic instincts to recognise the best approach.
</ol>

<p>(2) In turn derives from the years you've spent looking at the work of other artists, as well as the years you've spent in the shoot-edit-print-evaluate loop of your own work.

<p>I, for one, do not see in the field all the elements of composition I will later discover in front of the resulting print. In fact, my approach in the field is very simple and seat-of-the-pants, as I'll explain shortly.

<p CLASS=Centered><b>Hone your compositional instincts at home by looking at and analysing many, many pictures.</b>
