<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Are these pictures so bad? They seem good to me...

<p>Depressingly, I get compliments on my writing far more frequently than on my pictures. I should probably sell my camera equipment and give up any remaining pretense I may have left of doing visual art.Yet good non-fiction writing is surprisingly easy to do. Here's all it takes:

<h2>Write as if you were talking</h2>
 
<p>You don't need to stare at the keyboard wondering how to phrase a passage. Just imagine yourself explaining the point in conversation with a friend, then type out what you would have said spontaneously in that context. If there's one thing that every human being past the age of three does well it's talking. People practice talking so relentlessly, and so frequently, that one would think we all have a mortal fear of dysspeekia. Even when writing something highly formal, such as a term paper, write the first draft conversationally &ndash; make no attempt to formalize your language &ndash; then later go back to formalize as needed. (For example: the header to this section started out as "Write like you talk".) 

<p>If your typing is not fast enough or effortless enough to keep up with the flow of your speech, consider using a voice recorder to capture your spontaneous phrasing, then type from the playback, then edit for formalities.

<h2>Never assume knowledge of a fundamental</h2> 

<p>If you're trying to explain chromatic aberration, you first have to explain refraction and the spectrum (or at least refer the reader to such an explanation via a link), unless you know for certain that your audience will have the requisite background. So first outline your exposition, noting each sub-topic that needs explaining, then check that each concept or term you use in those explanations are either assuredly known to your audience or, if not, are explained previously in your document.

<h2>Self-edit</h2>

<p>(but only after steps 1 and 2) by reading every sentence critically &ndash; ask yourself "what have I said here that could be misinterpreted?" This has two parts: concept and phrasing.

<p>If you read anything scholarly, such as an article in a scientific journal, you'll find the flow is often tortuous. At every step the author considers all the objections his peers will surely raise and attempts to forestall them before proceeding to the next point. When writing tutorial material, one similarly needs to consider every possible way the reader will find to go off on a wrong tangent when reading your words. We've all sat in a classroom listening to the lesson being interrupted by question after question from fellow students: "you mean such-and-such?" To which the teacher has to respond: "no: I meant so-and-so". When writing a tutorial your job is to anticipate every such mis-take on your meaning, since you won't be there to answer each reader's questions as they arise.

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://daystarvisions.com/Pix/Kawarthas_2008/bin/images/large/Minden_rapids_5_K20D_ISO_400_20080622_2323_sz800x1200.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://daystarvisions.com/Pix/Kawarthas_2008/bin/images/small/Minden_rapids_5_K20D_ISO_400_20080622_2323_sz800x1200.jpg" width=550 height=364 BORDER=4 alt="Minden rapids 5"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>And here's another one...

<p>At the conceptual level this is often a matter of trying to intercept your own unspoken presumptions. If you're writing a tutorial on apple farming and your experience is entirely with sweet varieties like the Macintosh, then everything you write that assumes the goal is to maximize sugar content will be highly misleading to someone with a Granny Smith orchard ... and as I write that I wonder if my readers in Australia will even have heard of either of those apple varieties. So I would go back to add "(a sweet variety)" after Macintosh and "(a tart variety)" after Granny Smith, just in case. We can call this defensive exposition, in the same vein as defensive driving. ;)

<p>At the phrasing level one checks that one's words say to other ears what they say to one's own ears. I write: "A tomato grower's first goal must always be to thin his plants." I read that to mean pruning unnecessary branchlets from each plant; you read that to mean pulling out plants that grow too closely to each other &ndash; a potentially costly misunderstanding!

<h2>Double-check</h2>

<p>for typos, spelling mistakes, punctuation problems, and grammatical errors.

<p>Punctuate defensively. Your English teacher may have taught you that punctuation is logical and logic says no comma is needed if blah-blah-blah is true; but the comma is needed wherever it clarifies your meaning, so the reader gets your drift the first time through. Often there are two ways to read a passage and a comma or other mark prevents the reader from taking the wrong turn. In the last sentence, as it stands without the comma, there's nothing to stop you from assuming "there are two ways to read the combination of a passage plus a comma".

<p>Some errors are actually misleading, but all errors erode your creds as a competent dispenser of knowledge. In my experience, the single most common source of error has arisen with the advent of the microcomputer: cut-and-paste mistakes. I start to write "Here in Ontario the rain always seems to fall on those who don't carry umbrellas". I intend to change that to "The rain in Ontario falls mainly on those who don't carry umbrellas". But end up with "Here  the rain in Ontario falls mainly on those who don't carry umbrellas", because I cut the phrase "in Ontario", pasted it in the new location, then forgot to go back to delete the word "Here". The problem is that your eye expects to see what you <i>believe</i> you've written and so never sees the orphaned "Here" at the beginning of the sentence. The obvious and best solution is to have someone with good language skills proof-read for you. Such people are hard to find ... and prove less willing to comply with each repeat request ... so you may as well polish your self-editing skills, you'll surely need them. ;) Alternatively, brag to your spouse what a wonderful writer you, then sit back, pretending to be hurt, as he/she points out problem after problem in your hard copy. If that's not an option, and you have the luxury of time, put your document aside for several days. With a good bit of luck you'll be able to read it with a fresh eye and so catch some of those pesky hidden errors.

<p>For all that I've encouraged you to start by recording your conversational flow, another source of problems are colloquialisms that are so familiar to the ear that they easily go unnoticed. You may try AND solve this problem in your daily speech, but in the final draft of your writing you want to try TO solve this problem. Few readers will consciously object to "try and"; but equally, few readers will fail to come away with a vague impression of amateurishness.

<p>Similarly, in our daily speech we tend to leave out seemingly unnecessary or repetitive words and phrases. In my first draft of the first section I wrote "If your typing is not fast or effortless enough". In proofing I added the missing "enough" after "not fast". In my first draft of this section I wrote: "Double-check for typos, spelling mistakes, punctuation, and grammar." I didn't really intend to suggest that you check for the existence of punctuation and grammar in your writing; and I'm sure most of us would have understood my intended "punctuation problems, and grammatical errors". Nevertheless, Mr Spock would have called me out on a logic error; and we don't want to argue with Mr Spock. Which leads me to my final gem of sheer sagacity:

<p>Never write, but always proof, as though there are two people standing behind your back reading over your shoulder. One is Mr Spock; the other is Miss Primly, your sternest, pickiest, least forgiving public school English teacher.
