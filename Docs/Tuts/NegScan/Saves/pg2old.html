<h3>Scanning and Post-Processing Colour Neg Film for the Amateur Photographer</h3>

<h2>Vuescan for Final Scans</h2>

<p>The FS4000's native software is inadequate and thankfully there is an alternative. Most of you actually have two alternatives: Vuescan and Silverfast. Silverfast is highly touted for neg film because of its library of film brand settings. If you're scanning Kodak Supra 400, you choose Kodak Supra 400 from the menu. Silverfast then knows the colour of the orange mask instead of guessing. Vuescan has this feature too, but Vuescan goes one better: it lets you measure the exact hue of the orange mask of the particular roll of Kodak Supra 400 you're scanning. Vuescan don't get no respect.

<ul>
<li>4. Load film strip containing chosen frame in holder; start Vuescan; click preview.
</ul>

<p>Notice that the blue sky has mysteriously re-appeared. Same film frame; same scanner; competent software. However, even Vuescan can give you sub-optimal results unless you know exactly what to do. The key I've found is to set Color Balance on the Color tab to None. To understand this, we need to take a detour...

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Fig4Vuescan2.jpg" ALT="Fig 4" width=600 height=436 BORDER=2>
<p style="text-align:center">Fig 4. Vuescan histogram

<p>In Fig 4 I've switched to Vuescan's Preview Histogram pane. Notice that the pixel colours use only half the maximum possible range of brightnesses. This seems to contradict the idea that neg film has more dynamic range than slide film. Actually, neg film has more <b>capture</b> D.R. but compressed into a somewhat smaller <b>recorded D.R.</b> on the film. But that's not the explanation for this compressed histogram.

<p>If you force Vuescan to show you the histogram of any frame - neg or slide - with no behind-the-scenes adjustment (by setting Color Balance to None and Negative Curve to Gamma), you'll see that the preview looks extremely dark and the histogram is even more compressed than in Fig 4. It will be all bunched up on the left in the first quarter of the horizontal scale.

<p>The critical aspect of the histogram in Fig 4 is that it doesn't extend past either the left or right extremes. All the captured dynamic range is accessible. Hence the blue sky in Fig 3. Fig 3 also seems to be cloaked in a grey veil, but that's because the histogram does reach either the black or the white extreme. We'll fix this later in Photoshop.

<p class=Notebox><b>Note 1:</b> While Vuescan is a powerful tool, it's advanced mode can be intimidating. There are any number of settings, and most of them are very important. I saved Vuescan's settings file (vuescan.ini) after making this scan. To check out the settings I chose: first go into your Vuescan directory (folder), then rename your current vuescan.ini to vuescan.ini.save, then click <a href="vuescan.ini">here</a> to download the Vuescan.ini file to the Vuescan folder on your hard drive, then start Vuescan. This vuescan.ini was created using Vuescan version 7.6.6 but should be compatible with most recent versions of Vuescan.

<p class=Notebox><b>Note 2:</b> If you do check out my Vuescan settings (actually, the relevant ones are visible in Figs 3 and 4 above), you'll also see that Lock Exposure and Lock Film Base Color are checked on the File tab and the three Film Base Colors are specified in the Color tab. This was done by preview scanning a blank leader frame as explained in the Vuescan <a href="http://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/html/vuesc4.htm#topic3" target="_top">Advanced Workflow</a> instructions. In theory this should give you the greatest possible colour accuracy. The caveat is that the colours will be accurate to what's on the film, which is <b>not</b> the same thing as what you saw when you released the shutter.
