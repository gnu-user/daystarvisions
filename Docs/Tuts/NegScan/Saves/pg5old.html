<h3>Scanning and Post-Processing Colour Neg Film for the Amateur Photographer</h3>

<P CLASS=SmallNoteCentered>Version 1.0, page 5, <i>&copy;2003 by Dale Cotton, all rights reserved</i>

<h2>Photoshop, 8-Bit Work</h2>

<p>Everything that can easily be done in 16-bit has now been done. The important thing is that all the big colour adjustments have been done in 16-bit mode with it's relative freedom from cumulative error.

<ul>
<li>14. Convert to 8-bit.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>15. Use File->File Info to record location, film type, copyright, etc.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>16. Use File->Save As to save the 8-bit version as a new file.
</ul>

<p>Using Save As rather than Save leaves the original raw scan intact in case of editing disaster.

<ul>
<li>17. At 200% use the separate RGB channels to check for noise. Use Filter->Noise->Despeckle or <a href="http://www.neatimage.com/" target="_top">NeatImage</a>, if Despeckle doesn't cut it.
</ul>

<p class=Notebox><b>Noise:</b> One of the benefits of the non-clipping workflow we've laboured over so far is that it seems to significantly reduce the amount of noise and grain. Many images don't have enough noise showing at this stage to be visible in a print. (This image, however, is not one of them.)

<p>Using Despeckle in one or two individual channels is less destructive than applying it globally. I find the Median and Dust & Scratches filters too destructive, so I'll switch to NeatImage when Despeckle isn't enough. In NeatImage I work on a copy of the image saved from Photoshop, then after NeatImage is done I switch back to Photoshop, open the copy, then drag it on to the original image as a new layer.

<ul>
<li>18. Selective colour adjustment.
</ul>

<p>Now that we're in 8-bit mode we can use Photoshop's selection tools, including Select Color Range, to define any region or regions that share a colour deficiency. Once you've made your selection, use Curves or Hue/Sat. to correct the problem. In this image the only problems that still bothered me were the sunlit band of field behind the birch trees to the right and the orange leaves directly behind and to the left of the birch trees. I used Select Color Range to grab those areas, then used a combination of colour channel Curves and Hue/Sat. to turn the sunlit field more yellow and the orange leaves more orange. This is a fall scene and Reala was trying to rob me of the warm colours I'd impatiently waited months to capture. ;)

<p>(For more on selective colour adjustment see <a href="../Colour/pg1.html">Maximizing Colour during Post-Scan Editing for the Amateur Photographer</a>. Notice that the first part of that tutorial describes a laborious procedure for combining two scans to recoop the dynamic range of the original frame. You can skip all that thanks to the Vuescan settings we explored above.)

<p style="text-align:center">Fig 13. After selective colour adjustment

<p class=Notebox><b>Note:</b> Selections destined for colour and esp. for brightness adjustment often need to be feathered to let them blend in with their neighbours. But no amount of feathering will rescue too strong a change in brightness to a selected area. Also: I find I often have to select the sky to separately remove casts in it and/or in the non-sky portions of the image.

<p>...And from here on it's smooth sailing! Sharpen, save, and print - you know the drill.
