<h3>Existing Light Exposure Metering</h3>

<P CLASS=SmallNoteCentered>Version 2.0, Page 7, &copy; 2003, 2005 by Dale Cotton, all rights reserved

<!--h2>Strategies</h2>

<p>We've looked at four real-life scenes … two each of low-contrast and high … and we've considered methods to arrive at a final exposure setting using the various types of meters.

<p class=Notebox><B>Dale's Law of Metering</B>: the amount of time you have to meter a scene is inversely proportional to the value of the shot. Or: beauty and behaviour are equally fleeting.

<p>In other words: there is rarely enough time to think through the problem at hand. Your only hope is to know your chosen tools so well and to practice using them so much that your automatic reactions will be spot-on.

<ul>
<li><b>Centre-weighted</b>: it may seem as though a centre-weighted is hopelessly outdated and of limited use. In fact, centre-weighted is as good as any other because every type of metering has its blind spots, and you have to learn and practice with any meter type. Once you master centre-weighted you can respond nearly instantly to the complexity of any scene. There are several wonderful books by <a href="http://www.johnshawphoto.com/books.htm" target="_top">John Shaw</a> that teach the art of centre-weighted metering.

<li><b>1° and 1% Spot</b>: the same holds true for spot-metering. If you have the luxury of time, you can apply the full spot meter recipe and nail the exposure. Practice and more practice will shorten the time involved. For really transient scenes use the slide/digital spot recipe or find a middle grey equivalent region and meter off that with a guess at compensation in high contrast light.

<li><b>Partial Spot</b>: I haven't discussed the use of partial spot meters in the above scenarios because I've never owned a camera with this feature. My guess is that one would use a partial spot meter more like a centre-weighted meter than a 1° spot meter, since those troublesome areas of specular glare and deep shadow are rarely big enough to fill the compass of a partial spot.

<li><b>Incident</b> metering is accurate so long as the contrast does not exceed your imager, and you have to train your eyes to recognize when this is the case. The drawback is the time it takes to transfer the reading to your camera, especially if you are using a filter.

<li><b>Evaluative</b> metering is wonderfully easy and accurate ... once you learn to recognize the danger signs of a scene that will fool the evaluative metering mode of your brand of camera. For example, I use a Nikon camera and happily rely on the evaluative metering except for scenes with large areas of dark subject with small areas of bright sky (which underexposes the dark areas) and all-bright scenes, such as full-frame skies.
</ul>

<p>I own a battered old Sekonic Digi-Spot, which is a handheld 1° spot-meter, that I got second-hand. I use this in high-contrast light or evaluative-tricky situations, whenever I have the luxury of the ten or twenty seconds it will normally take me to use it. Lacking that much time, in high-contrast light or evaluative-tricky situations I'll switch my Nikon to 1% spot mode, meter the glare and/or deep shadow trouble spots and fudge up an exposure … about five seconds. Lacking that much time or if contrast is not an issue, I'll simply rely on evaluative if the situation is not evaluative-tricky, and apply a guesstimate exposure compensation to the evaluative reading otherwise. Whenever I have to resort to guesswork I'll also bracket the exposure if time permits. (Because I use neg film, that's fairly rare … I'm far more likely to bracket for depth of field or take a second shot if I'm concerned about subject motion.)-->

<H2>Final Exam</H2>

<p>How would you meter this dawn-over-fen scene? There is no breeze but the sun is rising steadily and the clouds are not holding still. Assume you have 30 seconds to work in; assume you are using your current equipment:

<p style="text-align:center"><A HREF="..\..\..\Pix\2002ls\113-03.jpg"><IMG SRC="Fig14.jpg" width=400 height=282 BORDER=2 alt="Click for larger version"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig 14. 113-03 </p>

<p>In fact, to get this shot my tripod and I teetered on a sharp, muddy slope at water's edge, surrounded by dense branches, and swarmed by mosquitoes ... so maybe 30 seconds is over-generous. ;) What would you do, assuming <b>5</b> seconds?


<h2>Further Reading</h2>

<p>The second editions of <a href="http://www.cicada.com/pub/photo/zs/books/" target="_top">The Camera</a> and <a href="http://www.cicada.com/pub/photo/zs/books/" target="_top">The Negative</a> by Ansel Adams, after more than half a century, remain the keystone of photography. While their primary focus is black & white film photography, most of the concepts apply to colour and digital. These books are clear and simply written - a joy to read.
