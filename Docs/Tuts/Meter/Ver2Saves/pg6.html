<h3>Existing Light Exposure Metering</h3>

<P CLASS=SmallNoteCentered>Version 2.1, Page 6, &copy; 2003, 2005 by Dale Cotton, all rights reserved

<h2>Scenario 4: metering a different high-contrast scene</h2>

<P>Here's another problem child:</P>

<p style="text-align:center"><A HREF="..\..\..\Pix\2002ls\112-20.jpg"><IMG SRC="Fig12.jpg" width=600 height=213 BORDER=2 alt="Click for larger version"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig 12. 112-20</P>

<P>As with Fig 7, this scene as a whole averages out to something brighter than middle grey. There is no convenient green lawn to meter off. Worse still, the clouds are extremely bright. The truth is that I naively trusted the evaluative meter mode of my camera when I exposed this frame. As you can see, it chose to sacrifice much of the cloud area to over-exposure in order to keep optimum exposure in the rest of the scene. There was a light breeze, so combining bracketed exposures was not an option. </P>

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Fig13.jpg" width=600 height=213 BORDER=2>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig 13. Same image showing (A) spot readings and (B) centre-weighted average reading</P>

<P>What I should have done would have been to either </P>

<UL>
<LI>Use the centre-weighted meter mode of my camera then apply one stop of exposure compensation (which direction?) to try for a good over-all exposure (same as evaluative), then take a second frame at two stops compensation to try to bring the clouds under control. </LI>
<LI>Use a spot meter and apply the <a href="pg5.html#recipe">spot metering recipe</a>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Let's walk through the full spot meter recipe using this frame as an example. Ideally, I'd like to retain detail in even the most glaring portion of the clouds without losing my shadows. The brightest portion of the clouds meters in at 1/2000<SUP>th</SUP>. The shadows meter in at 1/15<SUP>th</SUP>. That's 8 stops. If I'm using neg film, that's quite do-able: I expose halfway between the two extremes at 1/125<SUP>th</SUP> (centre-weighted wins again). If I'm using digital JPEG or slide film, this scene would be a good candidate for ND grad filters. Otherwise, I kiss the glaring clouds good-bye and use the slide film recipe: i.e., subtract 2½ stops from 1/1000<SUP>th</SUP> for my exposure. If I'm shooting digital raw, depending on my camera I have 7&frac12; to 8 stops, so again my best bet is to use the slide film recipe.</P>

<P>However, there is yet another interesting feature to this frame. The sun is over my right shoulder. When you have specular glare and the sun is either to your left or right (not straight ahead or straight behind), you can use a polarizer to cut down on the glare.</P>


<a name="digital"><h2>Compact digital camera metering</h2></a>

<P>Compact digital cameras (also known as point&shoots) come in two flavours: those that have a built-in histogram function and those that do not. </P>

<P>Without a histogram, you still have the advantage of the back LCD monitor. The general rule seems to be to use the evaluative meter's recommendation in low-contrast scenes and stop down 2/3 stop in high-contrast light. Then check the frame on the LCD to look for blown highlights. The problem is that blown hightlight regions can be too small to see on the relatively tiny LCD and/or the LCD may have a different sensitivity than the final frame. If your camera has the option of showing blown highlights as blinking regions, your laughing.</P>

<p>If you do have a histogram, read on...

<a name="dSLR"><h2>dSLR camera metering</h2></a>

<P>With a dSLR we can assume the preseonce of a histogram feature but with the downside that it is usually only available after the frame has been taken. With a histogram it becomes perfectly feasible in many circumstances to put the camera in evaluative metering mode, review each shot, then re-shoot if the exposure is too far off. What you are chiefly looking for is whether there are blown highlights, which is indicated on the histogram by a vertical line or bar on the rightmost edge of the graph. For more on interpreting the in-camera histogram see Michael Reichmann's <A HREF="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/understanding-histograms.shtml" target="_top">Understanding Histograms</a>. As mentioned, many cameras also have the option of displaying blown highlights as blinking regions, which also gets the job done. 

<p>The only problem arises when you have time constraints, as in doing action photography, including moving children, sports, wedding candids, etc. If you don't have time to review and/or can't repeat the decisive moment that just passed, you have to get the exposure right sans histogram, which means mastering the previous material in this tutorial. Bracketing can also be an option but with the downsides of filling up your memory card that much more quickly and/or missing the decisive moment. 

<a name="ExposeRight"><h2>Expose-right metering</h2></a>

<p>If you routinely shoot RAW format and have read <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/expose-right.shtml">Expose to the Right</a>, you have a very good case for exposing your frames so the exposure graph snugs up to the right edge of the histogram. Now all you need is to learn <b>how</b> to do this. Actually, if you've read through this far, you already know how - just use the <a href="pg5.html#slide recipe">short spot meter recipe</a>: meter the brightest part of the scene then stop down X stops, where X is probably 3 stops but depends on your particular camera. To derive X for your camera, just go out on a sunny day, take a frame using the above recipe and 3 = X, then check your histogram. If you see blown highlights reduce X and repeat; if you see a gap between the right end of the exposure data and the right end of the histogram, increase X and repeat. Now take a variety of shots to check whether your tentative value for X holds up under a variety of conditions.

<p>My own Pentax DS is brilliantly designed for expose-right metering. X does happen to be 3 for this camera; it also happens to have +/-3 exposure compensation; it also happens to have a (barely) usable in-camera 2.5% spot meter. Unless I'm doing fast action shooting, I leave my camera in spot metering mode and manual exposure mode (which makes me feel like a real pro ;). If fact, I also normally leave my camera set to f/11 for maximum DOF. So all I need do for consistently perfect exposures is to meter the brightest part of the frame, thumb the shutter control so the meter shows -3.0 stops, then shoot.

<p>(If you haven't been doing expose-right, the caveat is that you need to shoot RAW and you need to post-process nearly every single image.)
