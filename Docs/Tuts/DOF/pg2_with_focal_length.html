<h3>Tightening things up</h3>

<p>So far we've been using the lens wide open, using a large diaphragm aperture such as f/1 or f/1.2. Now let's narrow the aperture so that only the central portion of the lens can pass light. We see what happens in Fig. 4:</p>

<p>Most photons arriving from each point in the scene are blocked from traveling on to the film/sensor plane. Those that do make it through the aperture travel on paths that are closer to being parallel to the centre-line of the camera. Technically, their angle of incidence is shallower:</p>

<h3>Acceptable confusion</h3>

<p>Film frames and sensors are typically much smaller than prints. Let's say our camera is a so-called full frame digital or 35mm film, which has a frame size of roughly 1 by 1.5 inches, or 24 by 36 mm. If I make a 11 x 16.5 inch print from 35mm film, I've magnified the image 11 times. It follows that a COC that is 1/11th of a millimeter in diameter on the film will be a full millimeter in diameter in the print &ndash; which is certainly big enough to be seen. Nevertheless, there will be some COC diameter that is small enough such that it is still too small to be seen (or better too small to be printed as more than a single dot) for a given size print.</p>

<p>We can see, then, that some degree of misconvergence can be tolerated. This tolerance is what gives us our depth of field:

<p>Fig. 6. Acceptable DOF</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>In Fig. 6 we see a possible depth of field, resulting from a particular combination of lens focal length, lens aperture, subject distance, print magnification, and print viewing distance. Notice that the red-shaded region extends twice as far behind the plane of focus as it does in front of the plane of focus. This is because photon paths from more distant objects have a narrower angle of incidence than those from closer objects. Notice also that the red-shaded region tapers off as it gets further from the exact plane of focus. This signifies that the circles of confusion are getting larger the further we get from the plane of focus, and therefore the less precisely focused each corresponding point on the print will be.</p>

<h3>Focal length and subject distance</h3>

<p>So far we've considered the effect of aperture on DOF. Another variable is the focal length of the lens. The longer the lens, the shallower the DOF for a given aperture. If we compare Fig. 7 with Fig. 2, we see that the COCs are going to be larger because any misconvergence has more room to spread out in:</p>

<p>Fig. 7. Longer focal length</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->
<p class=SmallNoteCentered></p>

<p class="MessageBox">This means that wide angle lenses have more DOF than normals and normals have more DOF than teles. Another implication is that in practice the bigger the camera format, the smaller the DOF. For example, the "normal" focal length lens for a 4x5" view camera is about 150 mm. But a 150 mm lens on an APS sensor dSLR would be a significantly long tele. The DOF for a 150 mm lens remains the same, it's the application of the lens that changes.</p>

<p>Similarly, the closer the plane of focus (subject distance), the greater the separation between photon paths from the same point, also yielding larger COCs.</p>
