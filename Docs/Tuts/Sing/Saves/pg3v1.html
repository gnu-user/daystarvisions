<p class=SmallNoteCentered></a>Fig. 1: Duffins Creek Marsh 5120, unedited raw

<p>I chose the image in Fig. 1 for the third project in this tutorial because it has a usable composition together with a riot of colours and textures that to me suggests a cornucopia-like sense of the amazing Rococo richness of nature &agrave; la temperate zone wetlands. Careful editing will be needed to maintain these positives while avoiding the scene disintegrating into chaotic busy-ness.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Warning</b>: to my tastes, the actual capture is perhaps fatally flawed by too much out-of-DOF blurred foliage in the immediate foreground; this doesn't stop us working the image for what it has to teach us but will severely restrict the size of print that can be made from it. You might want to click on Fig. 3 below and snoop around at 100% mag. to see for yourself before continuing.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered></a>Fig. 2: Lightroom 3 beta>

<p>As in the previous projects, I used Lightroom version 3 beta to convert but again will pretty much stick to features that are common to other raw converters.

<p><b>1.</b> Open in your raw converter, examine for unrecoverable issues like mis-focus and blown exposure.

<p><b>2.</b> Change Temperature from 4200K to approx. 4738K. Not only is warmer light more attractive, your visual cortex automatically neutralizes colour casts such as the bluish tint introduced by cloud cover in this shot, so this change brings the image more in line with what I saw when I took the picture.

<p><b>3.</b> Change exposure by -1 stop. Correct for expose-to-right and pull highlights in clouds down from pure white, (No need to use the recover highlights slider in this case.)

<p><b>4.</b> Set black point to 4. Again: this matches what your visual cortext would have done when viewing the scene.

<p><b>5.</b> Increase Brightness from 50 to 96. This corrects for the -1 stop exposure change.

<p><b>6.</b> Change Darks slider in tone curve to -5 and Lights to +12 .This is as much contrast as I want to apply globally; we'll add more contrast locally, below.

<p><b>7.</b> Change Highlights slider in tone curve to -14. To further reduce glare of sky.

<p><b>8.</b> Examine image at 100% or 200% magnification: noise level looks fine; there's no CA; so no need to fix either of those. We will sharpen in PS, so we'll leave Sharpening at zero.

<p><b>9.</b> No other global changes, so export to Photoshop as 16-bit TIFF or PSD.

<h2>B. Local changes 1: pallet</h2>

<p>First step, adjust pallet to eliminate discords and match Mother Nature and/or your personal preferences:

<p><b>1.</b> Click on Fig. 3; save the full-size JPEG to your hard drive; open that in Photoshop or similar image editor.


<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS1-sky_selection-sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 4: Sky selection

<p><b>2.</b> Create a rectangular selection that just covers all sky like ND filter (red rectangle in Fig. 4); feather 99; reselect all but bottom (down to dotted yellow line in Fig. 4) to get leave only the bottom feathering.

<p><b>3.</b> Open Replace Color; click on cloud greys until all sky is selected; desaturate about -50 so sky is less blue-grey.

<p><b>4.</b> Save your sky selection in case it's needed later, then cancel it, so entire image is available.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS1_Replace_Color_dark_greens.jpg" width=345 height=543 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered></a>Fig. 5: Replace Color dialogue with dark greens selected

<p><b>5.</b> Open Replace Color; click on pure greens in main tree; adjust Fuzziness to include most such greens; shift hue left to add magenta, creating an olive green.

<p><b>6.</b> Repeat for light greens: making them less saturated and slightly warmer.

<p class=Centered><a href="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS2-Pallet_changes-sz1000x664.jpg"><IMG SRC="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS2-Pallet_changes-sz600x398.jpg" width=600 height=398 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered></a>Fig. 6: Pallet change results


<h2>C. Local changes 2: contrast</h2>

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS2_Sky_S_Curve.jpg" width=339 height=372 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 7: Sky contrast curve

<p><b>1.</b> Restore your saved sky selection. Open the Curves dialogue; click directly on the diagonal "curve" near the bottom left to keep from pulling the shadows down to blackness. Now make slight S-curve above that to increase contrast between darker and lighter portions of the sky. This change serves to bring out the inherent interest in the sky by increasing contrast.

<p>Another possible issue in an image like this with a fairly straight horizon across the frame is that a bright sky and darker land would simply divide the image in two. In this case, the presence of the largish tree on the left, plus some light areas in the foreground, serve to save the composition from schizophrenia, so nothing needs to be done in that regard.

<p><b>2.</b> Invert sky selection so now the bottom half of the picture is selected.

<p>The non-sky half of the image still shows the flat contrast of Lightroom's linear contrast "curve". How much we change that will strongly set the mood of the image. To some degree simply by printing the picture we will lower the contrast yet further, since paper has so little dynamic range compared to a monitor. Also, there is so much "activity" in this scene that strong contrast isn't needed just to keep the eye interested. If we simply apply an S-curve to the entire scene we will be adding more contrast to those areas that already have more than other areas. Instead, we want to apply contrast differently in different areas.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS3_Foreground_S_Curve.jpg" width=339 height=372 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 8: Foreground contrast curve

<p><b>3.</b> Open Curves; again put a stop point near the bottom; play with S-curves to increase contrast; I settled on a very slight curve, since I like the original mood.

<p><b>4.</b> In the History pane click on the box to left of the step before the Curves event to set a source point; set history brush opacity to about 20-25%; then use the brush to undo some of the darkening in the darkest areas of the foreground.

<p class=Centered><a href="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS3-First_contrast-sz1000x664.jpg"><IMG SRC="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS3-First_contrast-sz600x398.jpg" width=600 height=398 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered></a>Fig. 9: Initial contrast change results

<p>The energy of a picture is in its composition or design. Without energy a picture just sits there like a lump without inviting the viewer in. The energy of this picture is in the lines that flow from right to left and slightly downward like gently rolling waves, including the horizon and the tops of the cattails. We need a bit more energy, so let's emphasize these lines with added contrast.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS4-Waves_Selection-sz600x398.jpg" width=600 height=398 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 10: "Waves" selections

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS4-Waves_Curve.jpg" width=339 height=372 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 11: Slight darkening curve

<p><b>5.</b> Using the Lasso selection tool quickly and roughly select the darker regions in the non-sky part of the scene with emphasis on their left-right connections. Omit the red foliage on the left, lest it become too dark (see Fig. 10). Feather about 50. Apply a slight darkening curve to this selection, then undo with History Brush as desired.

<p>There is now a bit too much disjoint between the brightness of the sky and non-sky.

<p><b>6.</b> Restore the sky selection and create a curve with a slight dip in the main tonality of the sky to give a slight darkening. Fade as needed.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS6-global_contrast_curve.jpg" width=339 height=372 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 12: Deepen shadows and increase contrast curve

<p><b>7.</b> Getting there, but the overall contrast still gives the impression of a slight haze over the image. Create a slight S-curve to deepen shadows and slightly increase contrast (Fig. 12).

<p class=Centered><a href="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh-PS6-Final-sz1000x664.jpg"><IMG SRC="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh-PS6-Final-sz600x398.jpg" width=600 height=398 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered></a>Fig. 13: Final
s
<p>The resulting colours shown in Fig. 13 are not only pleasing (to my eye, at least), they're actually much closer to what I saw when taking the picture. But a side effect of the contrast curves we've employed is that the colours are now actually a tad too vivid compared to what was before the camera; I'll leave it to you whether to leave them this way (Velvia) or desaturate slightly (Provia).



<h2>D. Local changes 3: sharpening</h2>

<p>Whether colour and contrast editing is now finished or not is something to sleep on, But in the meantime we can continue by tackling another task: unsharp masking (USM). As mentioned in the first exercise, the camera I used to take this picture (Pentax K20D) gives beautiful results at low ISOs but has a strong anti-aliasing filter over the sensor, which results in more out-of-camera softness than some other cameras produce. We'll need to compensate for that with a fairly aggressive initial USM attack:

<p><b>1.</b> Optionally duplicate the background as a new layer.

<p><b>2.</b> Change to 100% mag and find a section of the image with a range of different types of detail to work with.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS7-Before_USM-sz600x400.jpg" width=600 height=400 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 13: crop at 100% mag. before USM

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS7-Sharpening_1.jpg" width=322 height=425 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 14: First USM pass

<p><b>3.</b> Open the USM dialogue, then set radius to 1.0, strength to 100, and threshold to 2; apply.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS8-Sharpening_2.jpg" width=322 height=425 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 15: Second USM pass

<p><b>4.</b> Re-open the USM dialogue, then set radius to 0.2, strength to 500, and threshold to 0; apply.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/Duffins_Creek_Marsh_5120-PS8-After_USM-sz600x400.jpg" width=600 height=400 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 16: crop at 100% mag. after USM

<p>(Notice how the radius 1 USM does most of the heavy lifting, then the 0.2 radius finishes off by snapping the finest level of detail into focus.)

<p><b>5.</b> Set the history brush marker to the step just before the first USM. Continuing at 100% mag. and jumping to 200% as needed, patiently peruse the entire image; wherever you see haloing or simply edges that are too sharp compared to the rest of the image, use the history brush at around 25% to restore some softness. The far field and windbreak trees on the horizon are beyond DOF and should be slightly out of focus, so apply history brush there too, as needed.

<p><b>6.</b> Now review the entire image again, this time looking for areas that are inappropriately soft (often at the edges of the frame); select them; blur the selection; then apply further USM to taste.

<p><b>7.</b> The very closest vegetation in the frame is seriously out of focus, not being included in the region of DOF. It isn't possible to use USM to make these appear sharp. They can be left blurred to provide a natural sense of depth; or (in theory) they could be tediously cloned out; but given the complexity of their surrounds even a clone-brush-enthusiast like myself would take a pass.



<h2>E. Printing</h2>

<p>If you've been following along, you've now got a full-scale (15 megapixel), print-ready image file. The sort of finicky editing we've done will largely be wasted if we should now send the image file to a budget-priced, dye-based inkjet printer. But if you have a pigment-based, profiled printer you may want to make a print.

<p>Much of the image has enough detail to tolerate printing up to 12 x 18" or so; but the pesky out-of-focus foreground becomes intolerable at that size. If instead we opt for an 8x10, the foreground becomes a non-issue.


<p><b>1.</b> With your final edit of the image open in Photoshop or similar editor, set the PPI (pixels per inch, often mis-labelled DPI) to 467. This produces print dimensions of 10 x 6.65".

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS9-Printing_curve.jpg" width=339 height=368 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 17: Printing curve

<p><b>2.</b> Either work with a copy of the image or add a new layer; then create a curve as in Fig. 17. This increase in mid-tone brightness will compensate for the inevitable loss of brightness and contrast when going from screen to ink on paper. (In Photoshop you can preview this effect by using the Soft Proof feature.) The curve in Fig. 17 should work fine for most photo papers, such as a resin-coated luster or satin like Epson's Premium Luster or Ilford's Gallerie Pearl. If you're using a matte paper, you'll need to exaggerate the mid-tone hump.

<p>The paper I use for personal (non-sales) prints is Epson Proofing Paper White Semimatte. I buy it by the 100 sheet, 13x19", box (S042118), and go through them like water. Despite the name, this paper is a warm-tone white almost identical to Ilford's pro-grade Gold Fibre Silk (and is perfect for proofing the more-expensive Ilford). If you also prefer a warm-tone white, I highly recommend this paper.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix3/PS10-Blue_channel_curve.jpg" width=339 height=368 BORDER=0>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 18: Blue channel curve for warm-toned paper

<p><b>3.</b> If you're using a warm-toned paper, one issue is that the slight yellowish tint of the paper itself tinges very pale (pastel) hues, especially sky blue. For this reason I modify the blue channel of my print curve as in Fig. 18 to compensate for the yellow tint on those images in which cool pastel colours like sky blue are important. For this image, I prefer the very slight warming of the grey sky, and so take a pass on this step.

<p><b>4.</b> In the Print dialogue, enable profiled printing, select the profile for the particular paper you're using, use your finest detail setting, then send the job off to your printer.




<h2>De-brief</h2>

<p>If I have succeeded in my editing, I should be able to show this print to someone who hasn't seen the starting version or the original scene, and that viewer should have no sense that the image has been manipulated. The changes in colour and contrast should look like an entirely believable picture of the world. While I've departed from the original capture &ndash; sacrilege to the Kodachrome purists &ndash; I feel the result is one I might have got by camping out at that location for as many days, months, or years as necessary, awaiting just the right lighting, etc. to occur naturally.

<p>An interesting and sometimes humbling exercise at this point in the editing process, is to go back to the original raw version, whether before raw conversion adjustments (Fig. 2) or after (Fig. 4), and compare that to your current version (Fig. 13). Have you actually improved upon the original?

<!--p>After living with it for two weeks I still haven't the slightest idea whether it's a keeper or not, or even whether I like it. However, I showed a provisional <a href="//daystarvisions.com/Pix/Fall09/index.html">portfolio</a> of images from my fall shooting this year to fellow landscaper <a href="//daystarvisions.com/Pix/RMSampler/index.html">Bob Munro</a>, and he gave the near-twin of this frame a thumbs-up. So now if I should later decide this picture is an embarrassing bomb, I can lay all the blame for it's appearance here on a certain Australian's broad shoulders... ;)-->
