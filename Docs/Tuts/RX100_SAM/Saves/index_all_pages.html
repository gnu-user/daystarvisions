<p class="MessageBox">Own the expensive and professional-class Sony RX100 or RX100 Mark 2 but nervous about using the S, A, or M positions on the dial that <b>real</b> photographers use? Fear no more. You've come to the right place.</p>

<p>Perhaps it's just coincidence, but lately I keep seeing forum posts regarding exposure problems. The cameras in this case happen to be the RX100 and RX100 Mark II (hereafter (RX100/2 when referring to both), but you'll find the same issues cropping up for most any camera. One especially frequent complaint seems to be blown highlights and/or over-exposure. After years of working with other model cameras and beating my head against this brick wall, I've come to understand that the automation in modern cameras is not designed to prevent blown highlights or even over-exposure. It's designed to keep purchasers from complaining about the opposite problem:</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>If the camera had exposed the shot we see in Fig. 2 in order to keep from blowing the sky, the woman and her space-suited companion &ndash; who happen to be standing in shadow &ndash; would have been darker than what we see. And that's what the camera company would have received a complaint about, <i>not</i> the blown sky.</p>

<p>Or, consider this scenario: Son and Daughter-in-law have just been pronounced man and wife. They come out of the church, stopping at the top of the steps for rice-throwing and photo-taking. It's a bright sunny day, but the sun is behind the building, putting the newlyweds in deep shadow. Dad doesn't have a master's in photography, he just wants his whiz-bang computerized camera to automatically get this shot right. And the camera probably will &ndash; by Dad's definition. It will meter to expose the newlyweds optimally, since that's what the camera is pointing at, and will not compromise that by trying to preserve colour in the sky.</p>

<p>If you let the camera make exposure decisions for you, fine. But understand that it's priorities have nothing to do with preserving highlights or capturing the scene the way it looks to the human eye.</p>

<p>In contrast, most people who purchase something as pricey as the RX100 are photography enthusiasts who have learned by example what technically competent photographs look like under a wide variety of shooting conditions. If you fall in this category, you need to realize that very little of the sexy automation this pocket marvel is chock-full of has been designed with you in mind.</p>

<p>The bad news is you really do have to learn how to use the dreaded S, A, and M positions on the mode dial. The good news is that it's not rocket science. In fact, it's actually pretty much a piece of cake. A bit tedious perhaps, but not an intellectual challenge. Not even close to doing your taxes.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>A tad fuzzy about the basics?</b>: First thing is to be really clear on the fundamentals of exposure: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. These are simple but essential concepts. If you are at all hazy about any of these three, skip down to <a href="#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a> to read the relevant parts of that before proceeding.</p>

<p>You may not realize it but you've just enlisted, and we're going to put you through the photography equivalent of boot camp for the next four to six weeks. In the army, besides learning to grovel and to do more push-ups than you thought humanly possible, boot camp could mean learning to use and maintain a bolt-action rifle, until you know it inside-out and backwards. This happens before you're allowed to move on to anything more sophisticated.</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>In photo boot camp you get a free pass on the groveling and push-ups, but you're going to have to put your RX100/2 into manual mode and leave it there for the duration. After boot camp you can go back to making use of the camera's automation. But from then on you'll do so with an understanding of what it's doing, so you can override it instead of blowing what should have been a great shot.</p>

<p>Fig. 5: RX100 mode dial set to MR</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Be prepared</b>: Before you get started, make sure you have at least one of the memory recall positions (MR on the mode dial) set to whatever just-get-the-shot settings you are most comfortable with. Even if it's one of the automatic modes, such as intelligent auto, save that as an MR option. By doing so you're saving the entire configuration of the camera &ndash; not just a position on the mode dial. It's a configuration you know will get you some sort of passable picture in a rush situation, whether it's little Johnny taking his first step, or that UFO that has just landed on your front lawn. A very good habit to get into is to always switch your camera to this emergency MR setting before turning it off, whenever you don't expect to be using it a few minutes later.</p>

<p>But for now, switch the mode dial to the dreaded M position. It's going to stay there for what will feel like a long, long time... ;)</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>M mode is not all-manual</b>: Throughout this tutorial I'll be using the phrase manual mode, referring to the M position on the mode dial. In this context manual mode refers only to manual exposure, it doesn't imply manual focus be involved at all.</p>

<h2>M Mode</h2>
<p>Manual mode forces you to make the decision for all three exposure factors, instead of leaving any of them under the control of the camera's automation. This doesn't mean making complex mathematical calculations. In fact, even in manual mode we have some incredible assistance at our disposal, especially the real-time/live-view preview that happens automatically on the LCD.</p>

<p>To get started we need to be literally on the same page regarding camera settings. First switch your mode dial to M, then in each of the following menu sections make sure you have these options set as indicated:</p>

<p>None of these settings is on the list because it's particularly necessary or desirable for manual mode work, except perhaps for the final one, which gives easy access to ISO. All we're doing with these settings is creating a KISS environment for the duration of the learning period.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Why these choices?</b>
</br>
<b>Single-shot autofocus</b> from the center focus point may seem, less than optimal if you're into focus point selection. By all means use focus point selection if you are already proficient with it. For other readers I'm just trying to eliminate a point of complexity.
</br></br>
What about the <b>metering pattern</b> &ndash; wouldn't spot be more precise than multi? There is a great trick to preventing blown highlights that involves using the spot metering pattern, but it depends upon the spot area being sufficiently small, and the RX100/2's spot area (same size as the focus area) is anything but small. Instead, we'll be taking advantage of the real-time exposure information to side-step the distinctions between the three metering patterns.
</br></br>
Why <b>auto white balance</b>? White balance presets are mostly obsolete. Typically, they are only accurate to the nearest 1000K, which is a joke. You may occasionally solve a mix lighting problem using a preset &ndash; and in that case by all means go for it &ndash; but in most situations auto WB is going to be more accurate than the nearest preset.
</br></br>
Why <b>auto review off</b> &ndash; is this to prevent chimping? Not at all. By all means assign an autoreview time value if you aren't working with moving subjects. But when trying to capture something in motion, having the camera instantly ready to take the next shot can be invaluable.
</br></br>
Why put the <b>control ring</b> (lens ring) to zoom instead of an exposure function? First, because it simplifies step-by-step explanations not to have to take into account that shutter or aperture may be controllable from more than one place. Secondly, the lens ring is just too darned slow and stiff for large, rapid adjustments.</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Once you press the menu button to exit back to shooting mode, you may find the screen completely black, completely white, or 'way too dim or bright. Press the down rocker on the back control wheel once. Now one of two things will be highlighted in red-orange: the left-most shutter speed number on the bottom of the display, or the F number beside it. If it's not the F number, press the down rocker a second time to switch the highlight to the F number. Now scroll the control wheel until you see F4.0.</p>

<p>Fig. 11: LCD showing proper exposure: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO corrected.</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Now press the down rocker again to return the highlight to shutter speed. Scroll the control wheel clockwise or counter-clockwise until the scene you see on the LCD roughly matches what you see when looking at the scene instead of the LCD. If a) your shutter speed is at 1/2000th and the brightness of the scene on the LCD is still too great, or b) if your shutter speed is as low as 1/30th and the brightness is still too low, or c) if you're within that range and the brightness looks fine, lightly tap the shutter release to exit setting change mode. Both shutter speed and F number will again be white. <b>But</b> if either a) or b) were true you need to modify the ISO setting. Press your ISO button, then scroll the control wheel up or down until the brightness of the scene on the LCD looks reasonable, then tap the shutter release to accept that setting.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>About the above shutter speeds</b>: In the above instructions I used 1/2000th as the upper shutter speed limit because that's as high as the camera can go. I used 1/30th second as the lower shutter speed limit just to avoid making the instructions too complicated at that point. If you're shooting on a tripod you can go to as slow a setting as you have the patience for. We'll be working on shutter speeds later on, so 1/30th is very much a place holder for the real thing. Actually, so is F4.0, and we'll get to that, too.</p>

<p>Next, take the camera into multiple different lighting environments and go through the same steps to adjust shutter speed and, if necessary, ISO, but leave the F number at 4.0.</p>

<p class="MessageBox">Like any good drill sargeant, I'm a mind reader. And my ESP is telling me you're about to put off doing what you've just read and instead keep on reading. No. Hop to it. How hard is it to stand up, turn on your camera, move about your domicile, and snap a dozen pictures, adjusting the exposure for each one?</p>

<p>The next thing we have to do is learn how to use a histogram. If you already know how to read a histogram, read on. Otherwise, please read <a href="#Appendix_B">Appendix B</a> before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Working with Apertures in Manual Mode</h2>
<p>You've read the aperture section of Appendix A, if you needed to, and know that aperture lets you increase or decrease depth of field (DOF) in exchange for an equivalent hit to shutter speed.</p>

<p>Your expensive Zeiss lens is at its sharpest with the least corner softness in the f/4 to f/5.6 range. Going more open or less open within the range of f/2.8 to f/8 causes little or no loss of sharpness, thanks to the automatic software distortion correction built into the camera's JPEG engine and packaged with each raw file. But going beyond either extreme introduces progressively more image softness. How bad that is is a personal judgment call. It's always a good idea to do a series of controlled test shots to see what extremes you'll want to avoid when possible. (By the way: you also lose some sharpness at the extremes of focal length &ndash; either the 28mm end or the 100mm end.)</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">
<img src="JPEGs/RX100-Flowers-narrow_DOF-sz600x450.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="No larger version" />
<p>Fig. 12: Shallow DOF</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>But beyond zeroing in on optimal sharpness, photographers use aperture to control DOF. While the sensor inside the RX100/2 is a headline item for how large it is, that's only relative to the overall size of the camera. The larger the sensor (or film frame) the shallower the DOF will be all else being equal. The ability to have only the subject of the picture in sharp focus and everything else in deep blur is an effect that many photographers prize, called selective focus. (I'm not one of them, or I wouldn't be shooting with the RX100/2.) You <b>can</b> get selective focus with the RX100/2 to a certain extent, as witness Fig. 12. You can narrow your DOF by going to larger apertures, by getting really close to your subject, and by zooming out to long focal lengths. The first and third of these approaches can push you into a trade-off with sharpness, as described above.</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">
<img src="JPEGs/RX100-Flowers-deeper_DOF-sz600x450.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="No larger version" />
<p>Fig. 13: deeper DOF</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>The opposite approach is to shoot for maximum depth of field, to most nearly have all of the scene from closest to camera to furthest from camera in sharp focus. In this case the relatively small size of the RX100/2's sensor very much works in your favour. You're getting a huge DOF already at f/4 and f/5.6. You'll only need to venture to f/8 in the most extreme cases. And beyond f/8 the softness introduced by something called diffraction wipes out any benefit that might otherwise be gained from yet smaller apertures. Yes: the camera does have an f/11 setting, but, no: it's not there for DOF emergencies. My guess is that it's there for situations in which you really need to reduce scene brightness but don't want to, or can't, go any lower in ISO.</p>

<p>Finally, another reason to change apertures is to let in more light in low light situations in order to keep from getting blurry shots due to really slow shutter speeds, and in order to keep from getting noisy shots due to really high ISO numbers. In this case you might well open up all the way to f/1.8 and accept the hit to both sharpness and DOF as preferable to camera shake, subject motion blur, or ISO noise. (Or you may open up because a shallow DOF is how you want the picture to look.)</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that f/4 is a pretty good, general-purpose, default aperture value. In press photography there is a time-worn aphorism: "f/8 and be there". That comes from the 35mm film era. F/4 is the equivalent aperture value for the smaller, 1 inch, sensor inside the RX100/2. And because we can default to f/4 instead of f/8, we get a full two-stop shutter speed advantage over the 35mm and full frame crowd right out of the box. (Something to factor in when thinking grass-is-greener thoughts about cameras with larger sensors. ;)</p>

<h2>Working with Shutter Speeds in Manual Mode</h2>
<p>When I took my son to the local small airport for a ride in a Cessna top-wing plane for his birthday, naturally I took a camera along to document the occasion. Turns out that 1/60th sec is a good default shutter speed to use for a moving airplane. Depends on a number of factors, but it's likely to show the blur of the propeller's motion and a bit of the propeller itself. Too much faster than that and you'll get a perfectly sharp, motionless-looking propeller that's distinctly out of place for an airborne vehicle. Similarly, too fast a shutter speed when shooting cars and the highway or race track turns into a peculiar-looking parking lot. No blurred wheels, no motion blur for the cars or background.</p>

<img src="JPEGs/RX100-Girl_Riding_Bike-sz600x450.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="No larger version" />
<p>Fig. 14: Girl riding bike. Only sign of motion at 1/800th is slight background blur</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>In contrast, if I shoot a walking pedestrian at 1/60th, the person is likely to show as a blurry mess against a relatively sharp background. But if I bump the shutter up to 1/1000th, I'll certain stop the person in his/her tracks, but I may well need to go so high in ISO that I've made a serious trade-off in pixel noise.</p>

<p>Like everything else in photography, choosing a shutter speed is all about juggling trade-offs. The first thing is simply how slow a shutter speed can you use to take a handheld picture of a non-moving subject without having the camera record the micro-tremors of your hands in the form of the whole frame being blurred? This is something you want to experiment with and even practice at, with OSS (image stabilization) enabled or disabled, according to your beliefs in that regard.</p>

<p>Handheld photographers using Leica and similar film cameras (called range finders) took it as a point of pride to take un-blurred pictures at shutter speeds as low as 1/20th or even 1/15th sec &ndash; something no SLR user could hope to match. They didn't have image stabilization back then. Part of the trick was using a wide angle lens, part was the lack of mirror-box slap in that style camera, part was the heft of the solid metal camera resisting inertia, and part was practice, practice, and more practice. Breathe out as you shoot, have a good stance, press the shutter release as gently as possible.</p>


<div class="div_pic_no_click">
<img src="JPEGs/RX100-Leaf_shutter_location-sz600x450.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="No larger version" />
<p>Fig. 15: The RX100 has a leaf shutter in the lens, not a focal plain shutter in the body</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>The RX100/2 does the Leica not one, but two better, by using a leaf shutter in the lens instead of focal plain shutter just in front of the sensor/film, and by offering image stabilization. (The leaf shutter also offers virtually silent stealth capability that many a Leica owner would love to have.) It would seem you have no excuse not to shoot at 1/15th sec or so. The gotcha is the effect of focal length. At the 28mm wide end, you might achieve such a number, but the more you zoom to longer focal lengths the more you're magnifying any hand-tremor blur you have. Another time-honored aphorism is to use one over focal length (1/F) as your minimum shutter speed. And in fact that's just what the RX100/2 does when you enable auto ISO. In auto IS mode (sadly unavailable in manual mode) the camera automatically bumps up to a higher ISO whenever a shutter speed lower than 1/30th at the 28mm end, up to 1/80th at the 100mm end.</p>

<p>Leica macho aside, the only benefit to shooting handheld at slow shutter speeds is to keep sensor noise levels to a minimum. If you find after practice that too many of your shots are unacceptably blurry when working in the 1/F range, and if you prefer sharper to less grainy/noisy, then set your own minimums accordingly.</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">
<img src="JPEGs/RX100-Bright_scene-sz600x400.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="No larger version" />
<p>Fig. 16: Bright daylight shot</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>At the other extreme, the 1/200th upper limit can quickly become a real irritant in bright light situations. First thing to do is bump your ISO down as low as you feel comfortable going. 160 ISO is actually the ideal ISO because it gives you minimal sensor noise together with maximal dynamic range. Going slower than 160 to the 125 and 100 ISO settings comes at a cost of lower dynamic range. Lower dynamic range means greater likelihood you won't be able to capture both the darkest and the brightest parts of the scene without bunching up the histogram at <b>both</b> ends.</p>

<p>But in many lighting situations that doesn't happen; in that case go right ahead to use those ISOs. Whether or not you do use them, you can still need to drop brightness. In that case, you start pushing up the aperture &ndash; happily up to f/8, unhappily up to f/11. If this is a problem that plagues you, another solution is to spring for Sony's filter adapter and a 3-stop neutral density filter. Bit of a hassle, something else to carry and keep track of, but gets the job done.</p>

<p>In general, however you're going to be working within the 1/30th to 1/2000th extremes and choosing your shutter speed according to how much you want to freeze subject motion, from wind in the trees to Sally's ballet recital, to Joey's soccer score. Working in manual mode gives you complete control over this parameter, so get out there and practice, practice, experiment, and practice.</p>

<h2>Working with ISO Values in Manual Mode</h2>
<p>If you've been reading along, by now you know that ISO numbers higher than 160 are pure, but occasionally necessary, evil. And we haven't even discussed that the higher the ISO number, not only the more image degradation due to sensor noise, but also the more dynamic range you've lost.</p>

<p>Fig. 17: Mika preening, shot at 6400 ISO</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Well, perhaps it's not quite so black-and-white. In many situations those high ISO numbers make the difference between getting any sort of shot or not. A dim church or museum interior, no flash permitted. Sally's ballet recital. Your own night out with the gang at a favourite watering hole.</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Again, the RX100/2's 1 inch sensor trumps all other pocketable cameras in low noise, but equally it can't match the noise levels of the larger sensors in recent mirrorless and dSLR cameras. There are dSLRs with lower noise at 800 ISO than the RX100/2 has at 160 ISO (including Sony's RX1/R).</p>

Set your RX100/2 on a tripod or other support, take advantage of manual mode to eliminate all other variables, now take a series of pictures of exactly the same scene across all the ISO options. An ideal scene might be an indoor room with a range of brightnesses that completely spans the histogram at 160 ISO and which contains a variety of colours and textures.</p>

<p>Here's the drill. Keep the aperture constant, start at 100 ISO, skip 125 and 160, then for each change to a higher ISO number increase the shutter speed by one stop. Note: the shutter speed scale (like the aperture scale, but unlike the ISO scale) is in 1/3 stops, so this means jumping over two consecutive settings and selecting the third. This is relatively easy to double-check, since you want to double the number in each case. For example, you might be going from 200 to 400 by skipping 250 and 320 in between.</p>

<p>Once you have the sequence of pictures, ideally review it on your computer monitor at 100% to see the progressive degradation that results from some combination of noise reduction smearing, noise reduction colour loss and false colour areas, and still-visible random-coloured pixels.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>By now you're quite familiar with the mechanics of manually adjusting all three exposure variables. What you need to do for at least a few weeks is take hundreds of "real world" pictures using this methodology.</p>

<p>As explained in the first textbox, you should already have a memory recall position to allow you to quickly switch to automation to grab an emergency, quick-response shot. But it also helps to leave your M mode settings in a relatively sane state whenever you can predict how you'll next be using your camera. If you expect to be working in low light, leave ISO at maybe 800 or 1600, and aperture at something wider than f/8.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are whole kinds of photography for which manual mode shooting is counter-productive. If you're doing sports or wildlife and players or critters keep moving from deep shadow to glaring sunlight, for example, this probably isn't the best time to practice your manual mode work.</p>

<p>But, equally, in many contexts you're going to find that you can leave all three settings alone from shot to shot and concentrate on other variables like composition and focus, knowing that no exposure gremlin is lurking in the shadows to spoil your shot. A glance at the histogram is all you need to check that the light hasn't changed.</p>

<p>Your objective is to become so comfortable shooting manual exposure that you never again have any hesitation about switching into it whenever it's appropriate. At that point you'll also have a good feel for which circumstances it's appropriate and for which it's not. For many of us, our list of inappropriate circumstances are very short.</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Consider an amateur auditorium event, such as a school play or talent show. In that environment the light level may well stay the same for the entire duration. Getting your ISO, shutter, and aperture optimized before the action starts could well mean that you could ignore exposure for the rest of the shoot. And you'll do so with full confidence that exposure will be one variable that won't result in lost or sub-optimal shots.</p>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<p class="MessageBox">OK. Stop right there! Reading ahead again, aren't you? I don't want to catch you reading this section until you've served your time doing the previous section's work.</p> 

<p>I stated at the top that the purpose of learning manual mode was not to become a manual mode convert and turn your nose up at all other modes, but to learn how to use your camera with true understanding. Automation as your servant, rather than your master, can serve a purpose, so it's now time to become familiar with the A and S.</p>

<h3>Working in Aperture Priority Mode</h3>
<p>When you switch your mode dial to the A position, you're telling the computer in your camera to take over control of shutter speed and leave you in charge of aperture. You can also switch your ISO to the auto setting, telling the camera to handle both shutter and ISO. If so, you can set the minimum and maximum ISO values you want to allow. What you can't set is the minimum shutter speed you want to allow before it jumps to the next ISO increment. Instead (as mentioned above), the camera uses 1/30th as the minimum at wide angle and 1/80th at full tele. If you feel that's on the slow side, at least make sure to turn on image stabilization.</p>

<p>Allowing the camera to control shutter speed is really no better than allowing it to control aperture and ISO as well, when it comes to your chances of getting the exposure you want. For one thing, as mentioned at the top, the camera's exposure logic has no regard for blown highlights.</p>

<p>If you agree with the camera's exposure logic in all or most circumstances, you're laughing. If not, the idea is that you can set an exposure bias, to tell the camera to always reduce the exposure it wants to use by 1 stop or 2 and a 1/3 stops or whatever. This is based on the wonderful fairy tale that the camera's exposure logic handles all scenarios with a consistent amount of over or under exposure. Now that you've mastered manual exposure and become old friends with the histogram you will quickly come to see just what a joke that is. Hypothetically, you could switch your point of focus from the bride's white dress to the groom's black tux to get two different exposures under exactly the same illumination. In fact, if you're in multimeter mode this shouldn't happen, but it's not that far-fetched.</p>

<p>Enough growsing. Once you're in aperture priority, use the rear control wheel to change aperture as needed. You now have no direct control over shutter speed, so when you need to override the camera on that, press the bottom rocker on the control wheel to pop up the exposure compensation display, then scroll the wheel left or right as needed. Problem is: while you're adjusting exposure comp. the histogram has disappeared and the brightness of the scene doesn't change on the LCD as quickly as you change the exposure comp. value.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Lens ring tip</b>: Here's a tip from Sean Nelson on the DPReview Cybershot forum: set exposure comp. as the function of the lens (control) ring and also turn control ring display to off. Both are on Gear menu page 2. Now you can see both the histogram and the real-time effect of your exposure adjustments while you make them. Downside: the lens ring is very stiff. It works better for small slow adjustments than for large rapid ones.</p>

<p>The upshot is that aperture priority will buy you a certain amount of assistance in rapid light change situations, but you'll forever be checking the histogram, then fussing with the exposure compensation dial to over-ride it's decisions. The real advantage of using the A (and S) mode dial positions is that you now have access to auto ISO.</p>

<p>A partial fix for this problem is AEL, which stands for auto exposure lock. Go into the menu system to the gear sub-menu, page 2. Change the function of either the center, left, or right button to AEL toggle. Now, once you manage to get a good histogram out of exposure comp. or sheer luck, just press the rocker button you've assigned to AEL. You'll see an asterisk in the bottom right of the LCD. This tells you that the computer will make no further adjustments to the shutter speed until you either press the AEL button again or turn the camera off then back on again.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>AEL tip</b>: One way to use AEL is to not even bother with exposure comp. Instead, point your camera in various directions until you hit on a spot at which the histogram shows you what you want to see. Immediately press the AEL button, then proceed to compose and take your shot or shots, in spite the fact that you may have the camera pointed in an entirely different direction.</p>

<h3>Working in Shutter Priority</h3>
<p>Everything above in the aperture priority section applies to shutter priority, except that you now control shutter speed and the computer now controls aperture. Again you can override the computer using the exposure comp. control.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>If you've got this far by following through with the exercises rather than just reading along &ndash; congratulations! You are now a certified Old School Photographer with all the bragging rights that entails. This includes the right, ability, and even the obligation to respond to forum questions from poor, automation-deluded photographers with all the long-suffering snideness that your lofty status now warrants.</p>

<p>By the way: I said at the beginning that, having mastered manual mode shooting, you'd be able to go back to the automatic mode dial positions with the knowledge and ability needed to avoid the exposures failures that are all too frequent when using them. What I didn't warn you about is that you're about to discover just how frustratingly incompetent those functions are at getting exposure correct. So you're unlikely to make much use of them henceforward.</p>

<p>Sorry about that... ;)</p>

<h2><a name="Appendix_A">Appendix A: Aperture, Shutter, ISO</a></h2>

<p>There are three factors that together determine exposure: aperture, shutter speed, and light sensitivity (AKA ISO).</p>

<h3>Aperture Basics</h3>
<p>Instead, of always making maximum use of the full diameter of the lens, strangely, we very often cut the diameter down, which deliberately reduces the amount of light that gets used to take a picture. Why do this?</p>

<ul>
<li>Occasionally, we do that simply because the scene is so bright that even at the maximum 1/2000th shutter speed we can't keep from over-exposing the scene.</li>
<li>More frequently we'll do that because we know that when the lens is wide open the edges of the frame will be just a little less sharp than otherwise.</li>
<li>But most often we'll reduce the size of the lens opening because doing so increases what's called the depth of field, or DOF. Up to a certain point the smaller the lens opening the more of a scene from close to the camera to far away from it will be in focus.</li>
</ul>

<p>The size of the lens opening is called the aperture. The ratio of the lens opening size to full open is called the f/stop ratio. We'll talk about actual numbers below.</p>

<h3>Shutter Speed Basics</h3>
<p>I'll explain this for completeness, but I'm sure you already know this one. There is a barrier called the shutter between the front of the lens and the sensor inside the camera. This opens when you press the shutter release button to take a picture, then closes after a pre-set length of time (except in bulb mode, which requires you to press the shutter release a second time).</p>

<ul>
<li>The shorter the open-shutter interval, the less blur from motion in front of the camera and from the camera itself.</li>
<li>But conversely, the shorter the open-shutter interval, the less total light reaches the sensor, running the risk of under-exposure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sensitivity/ISO Basics</h3>
<p>Both the label sensitivity and the label ISO are misleading. What this should be called is signal amplification, signal boost, or gain. It's exactly the same mechanism as turning up the volume on an audio device or the brightness on a video device. It's also much the same thing as watering your wine.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Example</b>: Let's say you're a spy, detective, or just plain nosy. You have someting called a directional microphone and a headset. There are people talking a hundred feet away that you want to listen in on. You can't even hear a whisper from them at that distance, but by pointing the mike in their direction, then turning up the volume, you can make out what they're saying. However: their words are almost drowned out in a sea of wind noise, traffic noise, static hiss and crackle. The more you turn up the volume or gain, the worse the ratio of signal (what you want to hear) to noise (everything else) becomes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every camera has what's called its base ISO, which is normally between 100 and 200 on the relevant ISO scale. For the RX100 base ISO is 125 and for the RX100M2 it's 160.</li>
<li>As you change the ISO setting to a larger number, you're artificially allowing the camera to use less light to take a picture. But you pay two prices for this magic. You're introducing more "noise" &ndash; meaning pixels with nonsense colour values that are randomly strewn throughout the picture. You're also clipping off the top of the range from darkest to lightest from the values in the scene that the camera can record. This is known as reducting dynamic range.</li>
<li>As you change the ISO setting to a number smaller than base ISO, you're also clipping the range of scene brightnesses the camera can record.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tying it all together</h3>

<p>For convenience sake we work with each of these three variables &ndash; aperture, shutter speed, and ISO &ndash; in a system of "stops".</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Why "stops"?</b>: This peculiar use of a familiar word goes back to the early days of photography when photographers used a set of thin black panels with various sized circular holes drilled in them to act as the apertures in their cameras. The panels stopped all but a specific fraction of the light that would otherwise reach the photosensitive emulsion on a glass plate at the back of the camera.</p>

<p>Every one-stop change in aperture, shutter speed has the effect of halving or doubling the amount of light that reaches the sensor. If you make a one-stop change to increase the aperture diameter, you've doubled the amount of light. If you make a one-stop change to decrease the aperture diameter, you've halved the amount of light. Ditto with shutter speed. Equally, a one-stop change in ISO doubles or halves the exposure result of whatever amount of light is reaching the sensor.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>More on doubling and halving</b>: However, your brain does not respond to a doubling or halving of a given amount of light in a literal fashion. It takes three stops of light change for us to experience a scene as being twice or half as bright. The RX100/2 lets us select 1/3 stop values for shutter speed and aperture (but not ISO). Given our insensitivity to brightness changes, changing shutter or aperture by 1/3 only has a 1/9th effect on our perception. Time has shown that to be all the fineness of control that's needed.</p>

<p>The above is a whirlwind summary of basic concepts. We go into more deptha, including example images, in the body of the tutorial.</p>

<h2><a name="Appendix_B">Appendix B: Reading a Histogram</a><h2>

<p>If you're not seeing the histogram in the bottom right corner of the LCD, press the DISP button until you do. Move the camera about, pointing at brighter and darker places. As you do, notice how the white stuff inside the histogram box keeps morphing its shape. This is a bar graph that is changing in real time. The up/down axis of the bar graph is number of pixels. The left/right axis is brightness from black on the left end to white on the right end.</p>

<p>No actual numbers are shown in the bar graph. It's not there to report numberical values. Instead, the shape of the histogram simply reflects how much of the scene is relatively dark and how much is relatively bright. But your eye already tells you that just by looking at the scene. The crucial thing the histogram does is show you whether parts of the scene are too bright for the camera to record at the current exposure settings, or too dark.</p>

<p>Fig. B-1: Histogram, spike on right</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>If there is a white line climbing upward on the far right edge of the histogram box as we see in Fig. 21, the length of that line tells you how much of your picture will be exposed as pure white &ndash; which usually means blown highlights. Similarly, if there is a white line climbing upward on the far left edge of the histogram box, the length of that line tells you how much of your picture will be exposed as pure black. This is a bit of a judgment call, since there could well be parts of the scene that should be pure black, but at least you know it's happening.</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">

<p>Fig. B-2: No pixels on left</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Another concern is whether there are any pixels at all at the left edge. Pictures with no pure black in them tend to look hazy. If you're shooting in fog, that's exactly what you want. If you're deliberately shooting what's called a high key shot, fine. But most of the time you want the left edge of the bar graph to snug up to the left edge of the histogram box, but without piling up there too heavily.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>What about ETTR?</b>: You may have heard Expose To The Right or ETTR. This only applies if you are deliberately shooting with the intent of optimizing the image in post-processing. Otherwise, about all ETTR means is to use the lowest ISO number possible while still keeping your shutter speed and aperture within the range you think is acceptable.</p>

<!--<p>All very well, but time for you to practice what I preach. Move into a variety of lighting situations, adjust shutter speed and ISO as needed, but this time do so with an eye on the histogram. Don't let a pile-up or spike happen on either the left or the right edge unless you deliberately want that effect.</p>-->
