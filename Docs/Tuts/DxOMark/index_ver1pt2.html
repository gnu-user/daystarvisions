<p>If you're into photography and are researching the purchase of a new camera, the DxOMark <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/" target="New">web site</a> is a gold mine. (DxO presumably stands for Digital x Optical.) This tutorial will walk you through getting up to speed on understanding and using the DxOMark sensor comparison tool without straining any grey matter. Read slowly, ignore the pesky <b>tech notes</b>, and follow along with the step-by-step instructions.</p> 

<p>DxO Labs is a French company that primarily produces a raw file conversion application called <a href="http://www.dxo.com/intl" target="New">DxO Optics Pro</a>. The systematic measurements they need to produce in order to incorporate each new camera model into their product produced a wealth of technical data. At some point they decided to turn this data into a public-service camera comparison tool, which you can access <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Compare" target="New">here</a>.</p>

<p>The numbers have no brand bias, since DxO Labs necessarily has no ties to any one manufacturer. And DxO's numbers have to be accurate in order for their raw converter to function properly and thus to compete with other raw converters. However, DxO' Labs numbers do have some limitations: </p>

<p><b>1</b>. The methodology DxO Labs uses to capture its measurements involves working with the raw image file output of a camera. Not all cameras offer a raw file output option. Many of the less expensive cameras only offer JPEG output and so are omitted from the DxO database. </p>

<p><b>2</b>. Another limitation is that a lens has to be used in order to take the pictures DxO Labs analyzes. Some cameras have a single lens permanently attached, but other cameras allow the use of a variety of lenses. In this later case there is some room for variation due to the inherent limits of even the best lens available for a given camera. Every indication is that this issue does not seriously skew DxOMark's results.</p>

<p><b>3</b>. Seemingly bizarrely, DxOMark does not test for sensor resolution. Yet, this is the first property of a camera's output that most people consider. In one sense, there is no need for a resolution measure, since the number is right on the spec sheet. A 16 megapixel camera has a resolution of 16 megapixels, which is 33% more than the resolution of a 12 megapixel camera, and 50% less than that of a 24 megapixel camera.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Tech note: Problems testing sensor resolution</b>. It's fine to say a sensor has X megapixels. But does a given camera actually deliver on the promise implied by that megapixel count? The answer to that is so complex that all one can say is: for one thing, it depends on which lens is in front of the camera and at what aperture and focal length the lens+camera is tested for. Another issue is the degradation in resolution that happens right at the sensor (anti-aliasing filter, de-mosaicing). 
<br><br>
Nevertheless, if a camera has a good lens attached, and that lens is used at its best range of aperture and focal length, slight usage issues such as shutter vibration are likely to overwhelm these comparatively minor factors. The upshot is that you need to factor the sensor's megapixel number into your purchase decision on your own. Quite simply &ndash; does the camera provide sufficient megapixels for your display needs, yes or no?</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Tech note: DxOMark lens testing</b>. Actually, DxOMark does provide resolution test results, but it does so under its lens comparison tool  &ndash;  not as a part of the sensor comparison tool. You can access the lens test results for each camera you select in the sensor comparison tool. Just be aware that the results require very careful interpretation. (For one thing, they entirely ignore the on-going revolution in software distortion correction.) 
<br><br>
The DxOMark overall summary number for a given lens+camera combo is just as problematic as the overall sensor score. So it's <b>just as important</b> to ignore those one-number scores and dig into the measurement graphs when looking at DxOMark's lens tests as it is for the sensor tests.</p>

<h2>Using the Tool</h2>

<p>Go to the DxOMark sensor compare page (<a href="http://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Compare" target="New">Camera compare</a>). Initially, you'll see this:</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO1-compare_sensors-sz600x445.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 1: Sensor compare</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Click on the dropdown button indicated by the red numeral <b>1</b> in Fig. 1 to select a camera manufacturer, then select a model made by that manufacturer from the dropdown below. Finally, click on the grey <b>Select button</b> at the bottom. Repeat this for as many cameras as you wish to compare. To follow along with this tutorial, you may want to stop now to load in the same three cameras I've selected, as shown in Fig. 2:</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO2_3_cameras_selected-sz600x445.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 2: Three cameras marked for comparison<br>(all from the same manufacturer to avoid brand wars)</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>The sensor compare tool only allows you to compare up to three cameras at one time. So if you have more than three cameras in your pallet, simply check any three that you want to compare together. Note that a few cameras will have the word <b>Preview</b> under their picture instead of the word <b>Tested</b>. Preview cameras have not been tested, so typically there is no point in checking a Preview camera for comparison. Once you've checked up to three cameras, click on the grey button labelled <b>Compare up to 3 items</b>.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Tech note: Perpetual Preview</b>. Most cameras are marked <b>Preview</b> because they're newly released. A few cameras will remain in Preview limbo for significant lengths of time because DxO Labs is trying to resolve some difficulty that camera poses in testing. Beyond that, most cameras by Fuji and Sigma use a non-standard sensor technology that is incompatible with DxO Labs analysis tools and may well never be tested.</p>

<p>Once the web site returns the results you requested, below the area in which you made your camera selections you'll see a results summary:</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO3_Score_summary-sz600x455.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 3: Score summary</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>The first thing to do is to ignore that first line  &ndash; <b>Overall Score</b> &ndash; for each camera. This is a purely arbitrary weighting of factors on DxO's part. It's there for people who simply have to have a bottom-line answer, no matter how meaningless it may actually be. 

The next three rows labelled <b>Color Depth</b>, <b>Dynamic Range</b>, and <b>Low-Light/ISO</b> also give single numbers for each camera. These are best-case measures and are of only limited usefulness, unless you plan to always shoot in bright light and ideal conditions. </p>

<h2>Individual measurements 1: SNR</h2>

<p>What you really want to do is ignore this summary and click on the tab labelled <b>Measurements</b>. Once the web page finishes loading, you'll see a graph labelled <b>ISO Sensitivity</b>. DxO Labs wants you to know to what degree they disagree with the camera manufacturer on how accurate their ISO settings are. For example, if you set camera X to ISO 400, DxO Labs may well feel what you're getting is actually ISO 302. This is interesting, but not typically a burning issue (unless perhaps you need to get identical results from different cameras on the same shoot).</p>

<p>So instead, click on the <b>SNR 18%</b> link:

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO4_SNR_graph-sz600x445.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 4: SNR graph</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>SNR stands for <i>signal-to-noise ratio</i>. Noise is a strange term to use in the context of picture analysis. We have to understand that in this context noise simply means false information. If a 12 megapixel camera captures an image in which 3 million randomly scattered pixels contain false values, then the signal-to-noise ratio is 9/3, or 75% accuracy. With each step up in ISO there will be more noise and less signal for any camera. The lines on the DxO graph simply show the exact numbers. </p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Tech note: More on noise</b>. False pixel values, or noise, arise from two main sources. Firstly, there simply are not enough photons (light particles) arriving from a typical scene to reach every pixel in the sensor. Your brain has sophisticated circuitry to literally fill in the blanks. Digital cameras are only in their infancy at doing this. Secondly, digital sensors are electronic devices. They generate a certain amount of electricity from various aspects of their functioning that bleeds into the image-forming signal. Both these sources of false data are amplified by the signal-boosting process we call increasing the ISO.</p>

<p>To interpret the chart, use the legend below it to determine which line color represents which camera. In general, the higher the line, the more signal and less noise. The vertical scale is the SNR number. The horizontal scale is the ISO number. The actual values (in decibels, or dB) are not important in themselves. What we're looking for is the separation between the lines. In our example comparison we see a clear improvement as we go from the smallest sensor camera  &ndash;  the Nikon 1 V3  &ndash;  to the largest sensor camera, the Nikon D800E. If any of the lines overlapped or had very little separation we could consider them as having equivalent ISO performance. </p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Tech note: Specs</b>. Between the Scores tab and the Measurements tab is the very useful <b>Specs</b> tab. The 7th row shows <i>Sensor size</i> in millimetres. For the Nikon 1 V3 that's 8.8 x 13.2; for the D7100 it's 15.6 x 23.5, and for the D800E it's 24.0 x 35.9. Two rows further down we see <i>Pixel pitch</i>, given in nanometers. This is the size of each pixel on the sensor. To a certain degree, the bigger the better, so this number can be useful to see as well.</p>

<p>To get a better feel for the relative performance of the compared cameras, you can also move your mouse pointer over any dot on a line. This will pop-up the exact readings at the ISO setting at that point. By moving from left to right from a given ISO point you can see what the corresponding ISO is for each camera. So, if we follow the 36 dB line we cross the V3 at just above 200 ISO. Moving right we get to the D7100 at just under 400 ISO. Finally, we get to the D800E approximately half way between 800 and 1600 ISO. So we can read this to mean that we can get the same noise level from the D800E at maybe 1000 ISO as we do from the D7100 at 400 ISO and as we do from the V3 at 200 ISO. In photographic terms that means that the D7100 is roughly a stop better in performance than the V3, and the D800E is more than two stops better than the V3. </p>

<h2>Individual measurements 2: Dynamic Range</h2>

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO5_DR_graph-sz600x445.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 5: Dynamic range graph</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p><i>Dynamic range</i> is how great an extreme from the darkest part of a scene to the brightest that a camera can capture. If the range is too great, the camera will either show the brightest areas as pure white or the darkest areas as pure black, or both at once. Most cameras can capture the dynamic range of most scenes with no problem so long as the proper exposure is chosen. But situations that challenge a camera are not that uncommon. One great example is an interior room with a window looking outside during daylight. Our eyes typically have no problem showing us both the interior and exterior parts of the scene, but rarely can a camera come even close to doing the same. </p>

<p>Looking at Fig. 5 we can see right away that the D7100 and D800E are quite close in dynamic range performance, but the V3 lags very far behind. While the gap closes as we go up in ISO numbers, even at 800 ISO on the V3 we see the other two cameras weighing in at 3200 ISO. This means the V3 is two stops worse than the D7100 and D800E at that ISO.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Tech note: Engineering DR</b>. If the dynamic range numbers look suspiciously large to you, that's probably because they are. When reporting dynamic range for film, there are some well-agreed-upon and realistic measures. But for digital the only non-subjective measure, called <b>engineering dynamic range</b>, provides numbers that are typically two or three stops larger than what we'd expect based on film test results or even from our own experience.
<br><br>
The difference comes in the dark end of the range. For engineering dynamic range a dark area is considered acceptable so long as at least 50% of its pixels are non-noise. In practice, that means that not only would you not be able to distinguish a black cat lurking in a dark shadow &ndash; you'd have a great deal of trouble identifying even a white cat.</p>

<h2>Individual measurements 3: Tonal range</h2>

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO6_Tonal_graph-sz600x445.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 6: Tonal range</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Clicking on the <b>Tonal range</b> link brings up a graph that is primarily of use when converting a camera's output from colour to black-and-white. The higher the value at any point the more shades of grey the camera can capture that ISO. More shades of grey mean a smoother transition from darker to lighter. These numbers are actually given in bits instead of shades of grey. This tells us how many bits of data the camera needs to report in order to store the grey scale information it's capturing.</p> 

<h2>Individual measurements 4: Color sensitivity</h2>

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO7_Color_graph-sz600x445.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 7: Color sensitivity</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>The <b>Color sensitivity</b> graph is parallel to the tonal range graph but reports instead how many distinct colour hues a camera can capture at each ISO setting. If a picture shows a red coffee mug lit on one side, there will be a gradation from the well-lit portion to the full-shadow portion of the mug. Our eyes will show a perfectly smooth transition. The higher the numbers in this graph, the smoother the transition will be in a photograph.</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
<img src="JPEGs/DxO8_Overlay_graph-sz600x445.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="No larger version" /> 
<p>Fig. 8: Pictorial overlay</p> 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Notice the red-orange-yellow-green bar on the right edge of each graph. Hover your mouse pointer over that bar to cause an illustrative picture to appear as background. As you move your mouse up or down the bar, the picture changes to show the better or worse quality at each level. A green line extends from your mouse pointer across the graph so you can see where the data line for each camera intersects with the quality level and ISO you're indicating. </p>

<p>Finally, just below the graph type links (such as SNR and Dynamic range) on the far left you'll see buttons to toggle from <b>Screen</b> to <b>Print</b> numbers. All you really need to know here is that its the <b>Print</b> numbers that everyone pays attention to. This is because a good photographic print is better able to reproduce the image captured by a camera than a good computer display in most ways.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>

<p>If we only paid attention to DxO's arbitrary Overall Score, we'd be missing nearly all the information that we can learn from this tool. Even the sub scores only give a very biased story. Yes: the dynamic range of the V3 is very inferior to the other two cameras, but we now know that the gap does narrow significantly as we go to higher ISO settings. </p>

<p>The reason the DxO Overall scores are meaningless is that they presume your use of a camera is the same as some mythical Average Photographer. If you never work in low light situations without a flash or studio lighting, then the ISO/low-light numbers are of little value to you. Similarly, if you only work with artificial lighting, you're much less troubled by a low dynamic range value. </p>
