<p class=LightBlueBox>"I just bought an SLR camera after using a point-and-shoot all my life. What are all these f/stops and shutter speeds and other technical gibberish? The manual that came with the camera seems to assume I already understand this stuff. Yet I can't find anything on-line that explains it clearly. Help!"

<p>Photography forums get messages like this most every day. In the following tutorial, I'll try to assume nothing, keep my explanations as simple as possible without glossing over any essentials, while skipping any unnecessary technicalities. Or perhaps you'd like to buy an SLR but feel intimidated at the very thought? It's all much simpler than you thought.

<p class=LightBlueBox>"I use my camera set on automatic all the time. It seems like half my pictures have problems, so I guess I have to figure out all the technical stuff if I want to take better pictures. Help!"

<p>Most modern cameras have a P (Program) setting to make all the decisions for you. Most serious photographers avoid P as though it stands for Plague. How can the camera know whether you need everything in focus or only the main subject in focus for a given scene? How can it know whether to give you the fastest possible shutter speed or the slowest or something in between for a given situation? How can it know which portion of the scene to expose for?

<p> I fully expect that the vast majority of people reading this tutorial will own and use a digital camera. Digital cameras are very sophisticated; so much so that it often becomes difficult to visualize some of the underlying principles, which is what we're trying to accomplish here. So I'd like you to meet a much simpler, more in-your-face camera, which we'll use just to explore the basics. <b>Fear not</b>: we'll transfer those basics to digital as we go along.

<p class=SimpleWhiteBox><b>Your turn:</b> This tutorial is a public-service; I don't make money from it. If you find any part of it difficult to understand (or even factually incorrect), please <a href="mailto:webmaster@daystarvisions.com">let me know</a>, so I can try to make it clearer. 

<h2>Meet the Nikon F2</h2>

<p>This is a Nikon F2 35mm film camera:

<p class=Centered><a href="Pix/F2_front-sz600x560.jpg"><IMG SRC="Pix/F2_front-sz600x560.jpg" width=400 height=373 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge">

<p class=SmallNoteCentered></a>Fig. 1: Nikon F2 (A: front, B: left, C: back)

<p>It was manufactured in 1972 and doubtless first purchased by a pro photographer or very serious amateur because it was very expensive back then. Let's take a closer look at all those forbidding-looking dials and controls:

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="Pix/F2_controls_labels-sz650x430.jpg" width=650 height=430 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 2: The F2's simple control set

<p>For Fig. 2 I removed the F2's viewfinder and set it down to the right to expose the top of the shutter speed dial, labelled <b>D</b> (normally hidden from above under the ASA dial, labelled <b>A</b>). There are five crucial controls on a camera, whether an old-timer like the F2 or the most modern of digitals:
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>) the <b>ISO dial</b> (formerly called ASA in North America, ISO indicates sensitivity to light<!-- and was called ASA in North America when the F2 was made-->)
<li><b>B</b>) the <b>aperture dial</b> (controls the size of an opening inside the lens)
<li><b>C</b>) the <b>focus ring</b> (moves the front element of the lens forward or back)
<li><b>D</b>) the <b>shutter speed dial</b> (controls how long a time the picture is exposed for)
<li><b>E</b>) the <b>shutter release button</b> (pressed to take a picture)
<li>[In case you're curious: <b>F</b> and <b>G</b> are the film advance and film rewind and are not relevant to digital cameras].
</ul>
<p>Knowing your way around these controls puts you in charge of the camera, not the other way 'round. (And if you're a math-o-phobe like me &ndash; don't worry about all those numbers, they're actually no scarier than the speedometer on your car.)

<p class=SimpleWhiteBox><b>Your turn</b>: (Some of this may come across as sophmoric but I can't know your background, so bear with me.) Using the manual if necessary, identify the controls on your own camera for all five of the above functions. Note that some lower-priced and/or user-friendly compact cameras don't have all five controls. If your camera is one of these, it's still invaluable to understand how the camera works underneath the hood, but you won't be able to follow along with the optional exercises like this one.



<h2>Lesson One: ISO and EV</h2>

<p>The F2 used film to record images instead of the photo-electronic sensor found in digital cameras. It will be easier to explain ISO by talking about film instead of sensors (unless of course you really want to delve into the inner workings of photo-diodes, programmable gain amplifiers, etc ... I thought not).

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Pix/Films_ISOs-sz540x310.jpg" ALT="Fig 3" width=540 height=310 BORDER=4>
<p style="text-align:center">Fig. 3: 35mm films with various ISO ratings

<p>Film is light sensitve. You may know that if you take a roll of film and pull the film out of the spool in daylight it will be ruined. That's because it only takes a small dose of light to do the job. Exactly how small a dose is specified by the ISO (International Standards Organization) number of the film. The higher the ISO number of the film, the less light it takes to put a picture on it. Drug store film typically comes in ISO ratings of 100, 200, and 400, for example. ISO 400 film needs only half the amount of light that ISO 200 film needs to get a clear picture on the film. ISO 100 film needs twice the amount of light that ISO 200 needs.

<p>So why do we need different ISO film? Higher ISO film, such as 400, gets the picture on film in very short times. This lets us work in dimmer light or hand-hold the camera instead of using a tripod in brighter light. The <b>trade-off</b> is that 400 ISO film is grainier than 100 ISO film, and the more you enlarge the picture the more the grain becomes visible and the more fine detail is obliterated by grain. So <b>the higher the ISO number, the more grain and less detail you get</b>.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Digital:</b> Digital cameras have ISO sensitivity options just like film. With a digital camera you choose the ISO setting with a dial or menu choice rather than by switching to a different film. Technically, increasing ISO digitally is a matter of stepping up the gain on the signal. The same 100, 200, 400, etc. sequence is commonly used in digital cameras. In digital imaging the higher ISO numbers introduce visual noise, or speckling. This is technically not grain but it obliterates detail just as effectively.

<p> The dose of light needed to produce an image on a particular film (or sensor in a digital camera) is called the <b>exposure value</b> (EV). Light is made up of extremely tiny particles called photons. Let's say the correct exposure for ISO 100 film frame is 100 gadzillion photons. In that case, it would take exactly 50 gadzillion photons to correctly expose an ISO 200 film frame, 25 gadzillion photons to correctly expose an ISO 400 film frame, etc.

<p>But why ISO ratings like 100, 200, 400 and not 100, 110, 120? This was probably determined by trial and error. However, we now know it is based on the physiology of human optics.

<p>To understand exposure values a bit better, consider the following chart:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Pix/Zones-sz600x130.jpg" ALT="Zones" width=600 height=130 BORDER=4>
<p style="text-align:center">Fig. 4: Ten equal increases in brightness from pure black (0) to pure white (X)

<p>Most of the scenes in real life contain areas in each of these ten shades of brightness. The very deepest shadow areas may appear pure black, there may be very dark but not quite pure black shadows as well, etc. (Don't be fooled by the fact that the above chart only shows shades of grey. We could just as well have shown shades of green from darkest to lightest, or shades of red, etc. Here's <a href="Pix/Zones_yellow-sz600x130.jpg">yellow</a>.)

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Key fact</b>: It takes a <i>doubling </i>of the actual brightness of light for us to perceive a single step in <i>apparent </i>brightness. Each step going from left to right in Fig. 4 reflects <i>twice </i>the number of photons as the one before it but produces only a 1/10th increase in <i>apparent </i>brightness. (If our eyes didn't work this way we'd either be blinded by the glare of a sunny day or be permanently unable to see indoors.)

<p>Doubling and halving brightnesses (exposure values) is the heart of photography. Simple, tidy, and easy.

<p>Now, taking this back to ISOs &ndash; at each ISO speed we can record the entire range of brightnesses from pure black to pure white. It just takes half the amount of light to do so each time we double the ISO number. So if we go from 400 ISO 400 to 800 ISO, we can record the same range of brightnesses from pure black to pure white using just half the amount of light (but, again, we lose more detail and get a grainier image when we do so).

<p class=SimpleWhiteBox><b>Your turn</b>: If your camera has an all-manual mode (usually M on the mode dial, set your camera to the lowest ISO and switch to manual mode. Point your camera at a blank wall, then any combination of shutter and aperture settings that yield a fairly dim image on the camera's LCD monitor. Double the ISO setting and notice how that affects the brightness of the wall on the monitor, Continue doubling the ISO and observing the change on the monitor.
