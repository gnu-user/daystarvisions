<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 1: Grab shot taken using method described below (Pickering Nuclear Reactor in the distance)

<!--h3>Background</h3-->

<p>My main use for the E-P1 is street/candids/snapshots work with raw output. For this type of photography I find I need instant response from the camera for at least a single shot at a time (Ye Olde Decisive Moment). Of the many variables that are subject to control on a camera when taking a picture, exposure and focus typically need changing most often. 

<p><!--b>Exposure</b--> Since I shoot raw and routinely post-process, I set exposure via the <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/expose-right.shtml">ETTR</a> methodology (keep histogram to the right but without blowing non-specular highlights). Because pattern (ESP), centre-weighted, and standard spot metering options all work toward putting the "subject" at middle EV, they are not directly useful for ETTR. Highlight spot would be useful if time and other camera controls allowed. 

<p><!--b>Focus</b--> For this sort of work both the E-P1's auto and manual focus systems are too slow to routinely re-focus before each shot, It's therefore imperative, if using AF, to disable the default expose+focus cycle attached to the shutter release button. The only real way I've found to do this is to put the camera in manual focus mode, assign single-shot AF to the AEL/AFL button, and press it whenever I need to re-focus. (Alternately, I could do an actual manual focus via the magnifier feature, but I find this takes me longer than a single AF event.) 

<p>The above would be acceptable if I could trust any of the available automatic exposure methods, but my insistence on not blowing highlights prevents me from doing that. And since assigning S-AF to the AEL/AFL button precludes using it for exposure locking, I no longer have that important tool in the exposure arsenal. 

<p>This simple quandary leaves me with two work-arounds, that I've been switching between since I got the camera:

<h3>Method A: Aperture priority exposure + half-press focus</h3>

<p>This approach involves assigning exposure lock to the AEL/AFL button, making use of the live view histogram, and half-pressing the shutter release to (temporarily) lock focus. When I find a situation I expect to be able to work in, I pan the vicinity for a light level that puts gives me the histogram I want, press the AEL button to lock that, find the portion of the scene I want to focus on, lock that by half-pressing the shutter release, then compose and wait for the right moment or moments to occur. After fully pressing the shutter release I carefully do <i>not</i> fully release it but only return to the half-press point, unless I know I need to either re-focus, change exposure, chimp, change ISO, etc. 

<p>So one disadvantage of this method is that I may have to do a half-press re-focus more often than would otherwise be necessary, which can put my camera out of commission at a critical instant waiting for the AF to find a lock. 

<h3>Method B: Manual mode exposure + AFL focus</h3>

<p>When working in light that remains fairly stable from moment to moment, I can switch to using M mode with pattern metering (ESP) and on-screen histogram, changing f/stop with the upper dial (infrequent), and changing shutter with the lower dial, since it spins so easily. As I move from one lighting situation into another, I re-dial the shutter speed while eyeing the histogram to keep the brightest values just at the right edge. 

<p>Since I don't need the AEL/AFL button for exposure locking in M mode, I assign it to S-AF, and no longer need to 

<p>The above is workable in many cases, but when I have a subject that keeps moving between different lighting situations, such as from sunlight to shade, or the light itself keeps changing, this approach becomes impractical. Then I switch to Av mode, grab an acceptable exposure while glancing at the histogram, by panning about the frame then half-pressing the shutter release when the histogram looks good, then keep the shutter release half-pressed until I've got the shots I want in that light. 

<p>If there isn't even time to grab an exposure, I'm left with little choice but to use Av mode and simply accept the (often disastrous!) recommendation of the ESP pattern.

<p>Below are the settings I use to do the above. Any menu options I don't record here are irrelevant:

<p><b>Mode dial</b>:
<ul>
<li>M, A, or S
</ul>

<p><b>Live View options</b>:
<ul>
<li>WB: Auto (but pre-setting a balance improves performance)
<li>Shutter mode: Sequential (I'll have more to say about this soon)
<li>IS: 1
<li>Output: I use RAW or Large Fine + RAW
<li>Meter: ESP
<li>Focus: Manual
<li>ISO: (as appropriate but not auto, since I want to be able to operate at low shutter speeds)
<li>Face detect: Off
<li>Focus area: (single centre point)
</ul>

</ul>

<p><b>E</b>:
<ul>
<li>EV Step: 1/3
<li>AELMetering: Auto

</ul>

<p>That's how I set it up; actually putting it to use takes quite a bit of practice, so don't expect everything to instantly fall into place. I'll be adding to this page in days to come.
