<p class="MessageBox">Everything in this review of the E-P1 applies equally to the <b>E-P2</b>, except that the E-P2 is a) black in colour, b) has an attachable finder, c) has a menu option for finder brightness, and d) has two new art filters.</p>

<p>I've own and extensively used the Olympus E-P1 since it was released ten months ago. That's the right amount of time to get over first-blush enthusiasm and second-blush irritations, but &ndash; <i>normally</i> &ndash; much too long a time to let pass before publishing a review. Howver, not only has the pace of change in digital photography  slowed a bit of late, but also the E-P1 is still on store shelves, usually at a bargain price, while the E-P2 is still early in its life cycle.</p>

<p>For an exhaustive technical analysis see the reviews on <a href="http://www.dpreview.com">dpreview.com</a> and <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com">Imaging-Resource</a>, but I always find it useful to get as many perspectives as possible when shopping for a new camera, hence this document.</p>

<p><b>Build quality</b>. The E-P1 has a metal exterior and a pleasant heft that suggests a return to the all-metal construction of days gone by. In fact, the metal exterior is a veneer on carbon composite internal skeleton, but you don't need to tell that to any of the admiring on-lookers that seem to crowd around whenever the camera comes out of its bag.</p>

<p><b>LCD and finder</b>. The LCD back panel is one of the better ones available except that the resolution is on the low end by today's standards at 230K. On the up-side the LCD panel allows viewing from very extreme angles, which compensates a bit for the lack of hinge-and-swivel. In extremely bright daylight that puts glare directly on the LCD, you still need a finder for accurate framing and ease of reading on-screen info. The E-P2's attachable EVF is one of the best of that breed, but it's still an EVF.</p>

<p><b>Flash</b>. Neither the E-P1 nor the E-P2 has a built-in flash but both do have a hot shoe.</p>

<p><b>Video</b>. I have virtually no knowledge in this area, but the E-P1 has monaural sound, 720p, and the AF stepper motors on the Olympus kit lenses are loud enough to be captured.</p>

<p><b>Lenses</b>. Olympus and Panasonic have a small but growing selection of Micro 4/3 lenses. Speed, as in max aperture, is not one of their strengths, since speed and size stand in opposition, and m4/3 is all about size. The E-P1 accepts a vast gamut of other lenses via adapter, including standard 4/3, Leica M-mount, Nikon F-mount, and Canon. (Caveat the effective focal length of 35mm lenses is doubled on 4/3rds cameras; your 50mm/1.4 transforms into a 100mm portrait lens just by virtue of being mounted on a 4/3 camera.)</p>

<p><b>Exposure control</b>. Having a real-time histogram always available is a game changer for anyone old enough to no longer believe in Santa Claus and the infallibility of matrix metering. There are two thumb dials <!==(a roller labelled <b>B</b> in the illustration above, and a ring, labeled <b>C</b>)--> (labeled B and C in Fig. 2, above) that can be assigned to shutter and aperture; ISO is accessed by button press then thumb wheel. Exposure compensation and AEL/AFL lock also have their own buttons. Only complaint is that the thumb ring is sensitive and fiddly.</p>

<p><b>Customization</b>. The E-P1 has a <i>very</i> complete suite of menu options, including dozens of custom functions: directly imported from the Olympus SLR line without the least bit of dumbing-down.</p>

<p><b>Shutter noise</b>. The E-P1 has the same default-open shutter mechanism as the Panasonic G1 and GH1, so it also has a similar muted but definitely not silent shutter activation click. It's much quieter than a traditional film SLR (<a href="http://thru-the-zuiko.blogspot.com/2009/06/e-p1-short-review.html">comparison</a>), noticeably quieter than a digital SLR (<a href="http://www.fourthirdsphoto.com/e-p1Preview/05.php">comparison</a>), noticeably quieter than a Leica M (<a href="http://www.imaginginsider.com/?p=96492">comparison</a>), but not silent.</p>

<p><b>AF</b>. After four successive firmware updates (from 1.0 to 1.4) the E-P1 now sports auto focus performance approaching that of the Panasonic G series and that of the phase detection AF in lower-end dSLRs. This breaks down in very low light levels and varies with the attached lens. AF speed is as much a function of lens construction as it is of the firmware in the camera body. The kit 14-42, while acceptable, is not the best performer, having been designed for compactness first and everything else second. Between EVF and less-than-stellar AF, the E-P1 is not going to show up in track or field camera pits anytime soon, nor in birder's bags. But it <i>can</i> be used quite handily for children at play (one of those areas in which you have to <a href="Using1.html">learn how to use it</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Shutter lag</b> and <b>shot-to-shot</b>. At 0.072 sec the E-P1's pre-focus shutter lag is right on par with the dSLR crowd. Shot-to-shot time is pokey by dSLR standards &ndash; something around one second &ndash; but, since the LCD is blacked out for the duration it can seem worse than it actually is.</p>

<p><b>IS</b>. Image stabilization on the E-P1 is not <i>as good as</i> that on dSLRs &ndash; it's superior: and rather significantly so in my experience. The camera body already has enough heft to dampen a fair amount of vibration; but the sensor unit is light enough that it responds superbly to IS. I routinely work at slower than 1/10th second speeds and hardly want for a tripod at 1/30th. Just as critically, there's no lag time as there is on my dSLR: IS in continuous mode is always up to speed. And of course the E-P1 implementation of IS is in-body, not in-lens, meaning it works along with any of your old dSLR or 35mm lenses you attach via adaptor.</p>
