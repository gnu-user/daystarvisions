<p>It may be that the pace of technical improvement in digital imaging has slowed down radically &ndash; or at least reached a plateau. Something around 12 mp for APS-C sensors and 24 mp for FF sensors seems to strike a reasonable balance between resolution, DR, and noise control. While manufacturer engineering teams concentrate on incremental improvements, the rest of us can finally get down to learning how to take maximal advantage of what we have.</p>

<p>What I have is the Olympus E-P1. For ten months now as I write this in May 2010, I haven't been so much as tempted by any new camera announcement. Panasonic has released the similar GF1 and Olympus has released the E-P2. The E-P2 is almost identical to the E-P1 save for the addition of an accessory connector and attachable EVF. The GF1 is along the same lines but has a different set of strengths and weaknesses. Panasonic also has the more dSLR-like G1, GH1 and G2. For all that the E-P1 still works for me.</p>

<p class="MessageBox">The E-P2 is functionally identical to the E-P1, the only differences being a) the black colour, b) the attachable finder, c) a menu option for finder brightness, and d) two new art filters. Henceforth, I'll refer to them collectively as E-P1/2, except when one of those few distinctions is relevant.</p>

<p>Micro four thirds is actually the cumlmination of something that got started nearly a hundred years ago by one Oscar Barnack, who took a roll of 70mm cinema film and built a still camera around it. <!--Ansel Adams met Alfred Stieglitz towards the end of Stieglitz' life. Stieglitz told Adams that if he were younger (like Adams was at the time) he'd buy himself one of the new small cameras and roam the streets of New York City with it. The small camera he was most likely referring to was Leica's recent invention of the 35mm roll film camera.--> Since most pros were using 8x10 view cameras, the 35mm rangefinders that morphed from Barnack's prototype were comparative marvels of miniaturization. And indeed, there is such a thing as too small in a camera, beyond which controls are hard to manipulate and the lack of weight makes it hard to keep the camera steady (handheld) for slower exposures. From WWII on the mainstream of small format pro camera designs shifted from rangefinder to SLR and sizes again began an upward creep, culminating in the behemoth that is the Canon EOS 1D.</p>

<p>Micro four thirds returns us to the right-sizing of the 35mm rangefinder. While no m4/3 model sports a rangefinder, in size, heft, functionality, and image quality they're very much on the same page. After the SLR came to dominate photography the rangefinder became a niche tool used by those who required portability and inconspicuous above all else. Indeed the E-P1/2 sees the rangefinder and raises to it by not even demanding to be held up to the eye, thus passing muster as a tourist's point-and-shoot.</p>

<p>As with rangefinders, the E-P1/2 has the reputation of having achieved it's small size by sacrificing in both  image quality and functionality. Although with some truth at launch, by now most of that critique is unwarranted. What is sure is that if you come to it expecting it to behave like an SLR, you'll soon walk away disappointed. Like the rangefinder, the E-P1/2 demands you approach it with a willingness to learn new ways of achieving familiar ends.</p>

<p>Before digging into those new ways, let's try to sum up the E-P1/2's mix of...</p>

<h2 class="Strip">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p><b>AF</b>. After four successive firmware updates (from 1.0 to 1.4) the E-P1/2 now sports auto focus performance approaching that of the Panasonic G series and arguably on par with the phase detection AF in lower-end dSLRs. This breaks down in very low light levels and varies with the attached lens. The kit 14-42, while acceptable, is not the best performer. Between EVF and less-than-stellar AF, the E-P1/2 is not going to show up in track or field camera pits anytime soon, nor in birder's bags. But it <i>can</i> be used quite handily for children at play (one of those areas in which you have to learn how to use it.)</p>

<p><b>Shutter lag</b> and <b>shot-to-shot</b>. At 0.072 sec the E-P1/2's pre-focus shutter lag is right on par with the dSLR crowd. Shot-to-shot time is pokey by dSLR standards &ndash; something around one second &ndash; but, since the LCD is blacked out for the duration it can seem worse than it actually is.</p>

<p><b>IS</b>. Image stabilization on the E-P1/2 is not <i>as good as</i> that on dSLRs &ndash; it's superior: and by no small margin in my experience. The camera body already has enough heft to dampen a fair amount of vibration; but the sensor unit is light enough that it responds superbly to IS. I routinely work at slower than 1/10th second speeds and hardly want for a tripod at 1/30th. Just as critically, there's no lag time as there is on my dSLR: IS in continuous mode is always up to speed. And of course the E-P1/2 implementation of IS is in-body, not in-lense, meaning it works along with any of your old dSLR or 35mm lenses you attach via adaptor.</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p><b>Build quality</b>. The E-P1/2 has a metal exterior and a pleasant heft that suggests a return to the all-metal construction of days gone by. In fact, the metal exterior is a veneer on carbon composite internal skeleton, but you don't need to tell that to any of the admiring on-lookers that seem to crowd around whenever the camera comes out of its bag.</p>

<p><b>LCD and finder</b>. The LCD is one of the better ones available except that the resolution is on the low end by today's standards at 230K. On the up-side the LCD panel allows viewing from very extreme angles, which compensates a bit for the lack of hinge-and-swivel. In extremely bright daylight that puts glare directly on the LCD, you still need a finder for accurate framing and ease of reading on-screen info. The E-P2's attachable EVF is one of the best of that breed, but it's still an EVF.</p>

<p><b>Flash</b>. Neither the E-P1 nor the E-P2 has a built-in flash but both do have a hot shoe.</p>

<p><b>Video</b>. I have virtually no knowledge in this area, but the E-P1 has monaural sound, 720p, and the AF stepper motors on the Olympus kit lenses are loud enough to be captured.</p>

<p><b>Lenses</b>. Olympus and Panasonic have a small but growing selection of Micro 4/3 lenses. Speed, as in max aperture, is not one of their strengths, since speed and size stand in opposition, and m4/3 is all about size. The E-P1/2 accepts a vast gamut of other lenses via adapter, including standard 4/3, Leica M-mount, Nikon F-mount, and Canon. (Caveat the effective focal length of 35mm lenses is doubled on 4/3rds cameras; your 50mm/1.4 transforms into a 100mm portrait lens just by virtue of being mounted on a 4/3 camera.)</p>

<p><b>Exposure control</b>. Having a real-time histogram always available is a game changer for anyone old enough to no longer believe in Santa Claus and the infallibility of matrix metering. There are two thumb dials (a roller and a ring) that can be assigned to shutter and aperture; ISO is accessed by button press then thumb wheel. Exposure compensation and AEL/AFL lock also have their own buttons. Only complaint is that the thumb ring is sensitive and fiddly.</p>

<p><b>Customization</b>. The E-P1/2 has a very complete suite of menu options, including dozens of custom functions: directly imported from the Olympus SLR line without the least bit of dumbing-down.</p>

<h3>IQ</h3>
<p><b>Resolution</b>. 12 mp is 12 mp: getting into 645 + colour film territory, and fine for A3 landscapes and A2 portraits.</p>

<p><b>DR</b>. I see between 8 and 9 stops at low ISOs, depending on how much shadow noise you care to put up with.</p>

<p><b>Noise</b>. Even though both Panasonic and Olympus use the same sensor, Olympus handles noise levels beautifully with results equal to or better than all but the best APS-C dSLRs. (Panasonic typically has banding issues above 1000 ISO.)</p>

<p><b>Colour</b>. Olympus has this reputation for excellence in out-of-camera JPEG colour. It's white balance seems better than average.</p>

<p>Since the E-P1/2 is the digital equivalent of the 35mm rangefinder, it's appropriate uses for the veteran photog are much the same: It excels at street and candids; it serves fine as a carry-everywhere for vacations, hikes, what-have-you. As mentioned, it's not the first go-to for traditional landscape work, sports, or wildlife, including birds in flight. For the novice and casual shooter, any of a thousand point &amp; shoots are going to serve as well, with the added advantage of being small enough to pocket.</p>

<p>The E-P1/2 is also <b>contra-indicated</b> for those who just <i>like</i> the <b>viewfinder</b> experience (or who need reading glasses or bifocals but refuse to wear them) and those for whom <b>flash</b> is a non-optional part of the photographic experience. (Yes: you can put a flash unit on the hot shoe, but then you've defeated both the portability and the inconspicuousness of the camera. Yes: there is a cute flash unit designed for the camera, but it's crippled by lack of a bounce-flash swivel.)</p>

<p>The E-P1/2 weighs a few ounces more and measures a bit larger than a typical point &amp; shoot. And that's really the litmus test for this camera: ultimately, if you don't understand in your <i>bones</i> why that extra bit of size and mass are worth carrying, then take a pass and move on.</p>
