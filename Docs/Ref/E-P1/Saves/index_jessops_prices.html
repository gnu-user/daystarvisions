<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 1: Silver Olympus E-P1 with 17mm lens; White Olympus E-P1 with 14-42 zoom lens

<p>As I write this in mid-June, the Olympus E-P1 &ndash; nay: the very thought of the camera, since it isn't even available for purchase &ndash; is taking the photography world by storm. Based on the sheer number of page hits, forum posts, previews and first looks, etc. I can't recall that any camera has ever generated such an explosive level of initial interest. While one might with normal prudence wait for the camera to ship and be reviewed before making a go/no-go purchase decision, in the case of the E-P1 it is already so heavily pre-ordered that it's likely now a question how many months one will have to wait for orders placed today, let alone a few months from now.

<p>The purpose of this guide, then, is to provide essential purchase decision information about the E-P1 in as succinct and as usable a format as possible. There is already plenty of information (and even more mis-information) available for those trying to make an informed purchase or pre-order decision. Once it ships an added focus will be tips and tricks for using it.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox>This is a work in progress and hopefully a community effort. If you have corrections, suggestions, or material to add please e-mail me at webmaster@daystarvisions.com. I attribute all material used unless you ask to remain anonymous. I'm trying to maximize objectivity, minimize personal bias, and have no ulterior motivation here except to provide a service to the photographic community.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 2: White Olympus E-P1 cut in half

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox>As you can see from Fig. 2, the E-P1's body is internally some sort of polycarbonate plated with a combination of stainless steel and aluminum. All-metal construction has been increasingly rare since the 1980s, so even metal plating puts the E-P1 in a higher stratum of classiness.

<h2 class=Spacer><a name="WhatIsIt">What is it?</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>The E-P1 is one of only three cameras made (along with the Sigma DP1 and DP2) that share its design characteristics:

<ul>
<li>Small body with rectangular compact camera styling
<li>Large, dSLR-level, sensor inside
<li>No peer-through viewfinder: back LCD monitor only
<li>Usable with a variety of lenses (interchangeable lens mount like an SLR).
</ul>

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Tech talk</b>: The E-P1 belongs to a family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_System"><b>micro four thirds</b></a> (&#956;43) cameras that also includes the Panasonic G1 and GH1, but micro four thirds does not completely specify the E-P1, since micro four/thirds has nothing to say about what sort of viewfinder is used. 

<p>The E-P1 is neither an SLR, nor a TLR, nor a rangefinder, nor a point&shoot compact, nor a view camera. One might call the E-P1 a <b>large-sensor compact (LSC)</b>, to introduce a new term for a new category of camera.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="KeyFeatures">Key Features</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p><ul>
<li>Compact camera size (smaller and lighter than the smallest dSLR)
<li>dSLR-class image quality
<li>Always-on live view
<li>In-body image stabilization (automatically works with any lens used)
<li>Configurable interface: point&shoot simplicity or full dSLR-level control
<li>HD/720p video capture with stereo sound
<li>Interchangeable lens mount
<li>Accepts standard SD and SDHC memory cards.
</ul>

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Tech talk</b>: <b>Live view</b> just means that the image on the back LCD shows the changing view the lens sees in real time. This has always been the case with digital point&shoot cameras; but until recently the back LCD on dSLRs only showed an image after capture or in review mode.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Tech talk: </b><b>Image stabilization</b> means that the sensor attempts to compensate for jerky motion as you handhold the camera by means of miniature gyroscopes.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="WhoFor">Who is it for?</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>We can only guess, but I see Olympus as having several different target audiences for this camera. Some will buy it for its capabilities; others will be taken in by its sheer good looks and buy it as a retro chic fashion statement. The His and Hers colour schemes and accessory carrying cases are for the later demographic.

<h3>Fashion and fun</h3>

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="E-P1_silver_17mm_people_1_rdax_450x325.jpg" width=450 height=325 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 3: Olympus promo shot

<p>Much of the promo material (Fig. 3) targets this demographic, as do the scene modes, art filters, and the full auto option on the mode dial. The larger sensor's ability to work in low light combined with image stabilization actually make this a better camera for indoor, bar, concert, etc. than any purse-sized point&shoot.

<h3>Mom & Pop travel plus special occasions</h3>

<p>The E-P1 will be just as difficult to see in bright daylight as any point&shoot, but that doesn't seem to phase the thousands of tourists the swarm over the Grand Canyon's vantage points every day. The E-P1 is probably too much camera for this demographic, but it certainly can't hurt.

<h3>SLR substitute for hiking and travel</h3>

<p>The image quality is there. Can you live without a peer-through finder?

<h3>RF substitute for street/candids/snaps, especially low-light</h3>

<p>This may be the ideal purposing for this camera. The E-P1 looks like a tourist p&s, is used like a tourist p&s, and puts strangers at ease like a tourist p&s. As a bonus, the combination of in-camera image stabilization plus reasonable image quality at higher ISOs means candids can also be taken indoors without flash.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: Anyone who has ever done <b>street or candids</b> with a digital p&s will have realized that doing so takes inconspicuousness to a whole new level. Any camera you hold to your eye marks you as a serious shooter and immediately makes people <a href="http://daystarvisions.com/Docs/Rvws/OlyPen/Aware_of_SLR-sz500x476.jpg">self-conscious</a>. Put a black SLR to your eye and you may as well be aiming a howitzer. In contrast, people assume that anyone who is holding a smallish camera <a href="http://daystarvisions.com/Docs/Rvws/OlyPen/PnS-sz500x474.jpg">out at arm's length</a> to frame is taking amateur vacation/family snapshots and is therefore either focused on family members or some building or other aspect of the scenery, just as they themselves would be doing in the same circumstances.

<p>A large subset of the later two demographics have been asking &ndash;


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="">Where is the all-black version?</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>Probable reasons for the current lack of an all-black model:
<ul>
<li>there are already too many lens+body combo packages
<li>the silver+black model was designed to be masculine/conservative
<li>all-black doesn't fit in with the retro, original PEN styling.

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="E-P1_white_back-sz450x260.jpg" width=450 height=260 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 4: Olympus promo shot: E-P1 back view

<p>Let's get this out of the way right off the top:

<p><b>If you need a peer-into finder with critical focus capability for the type of shooting you do, look elsewhere.</b>

<p>At least half of the initial reaction to this camera has been protestations and indignation over the lack of a viewfinder. Panasonic already has two micro 4/3 cameras with viewfinders (G1 and GH1); Olympus has one in development. Samsung has the APS-C NX. Leica has the M8.2 rangefinder. These cameras are not noticeably smaller than the smallest dSLRs, such as the Canon Rebel series and the Olympus E-450 and E-620. So it's really very simple:

<p><b>The E-P1 has the same LCD-only viewing capability as a typical point & shoot and can be used in the same way and under the same conditions.</b>

<p>The reason there's been so much indignation over the E-P1 is that photographers <i>really</i> want a camera as small as the E-P1 but with complete dSLR functionality and IQ. That's simply not possible with today's technology nor is it likely to be for years to come. Here are some roads not taken with the E-P1:
<ul>
<li>Yes: Olympus could have stuck a little <b>tunnel finder</b> in the E-P1 just as they have done in so many of their point&shoot compact digitals. Such finders have between 80% and 85% coverage, parallax issues, and no focusing facilities. 
<li>Instead, Olympus provides a hot-shoe <b>optical finder</b> (VF-4) for the 17mm prime, and will presumably do so for each micro 4/3 prime they release in the future. Again: these lack focus facility and parallax issues but provide a far bigger image and coverage than a tunnel finder. 
<li>Implementing a true <b>range finder</b> would have made the camera as big as a Leica M, added enormously to the selling price, and still suffered from parallax and unsuitability with long focal lengths. Plus: Mike Johnston makes the <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/06/finding-the-view-and-zooming-it-too.html">excellent point</a> that rangefinders and zoom lenses don't mix.
<li>A <b>miniature EVF</b> might be feasible but the complaints would have been as endless as the compromises inherent in its design. Battery drain would have been a further issue. As well, I suspect Olympus simply didn't have a prime-time EVF that would have been available in time for this camera.
</ul>

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: channeled from my paternal grandfather who used an 8x10 view camera for his entire working career. Stuff a light-weight <b>dark cloth</b> in your pocket and drape it over your head when shooting in bright light. Alternately, substitute a poncho, jacket, or cape. OK: maybe not the best idea for street work. ;)

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: if using the <b>hot-shoe finder</b>, calculate the <b>hyperfocal distance</b> for your favourite f/stop for the focal length of the lens you're using, dial in that distance on the LCD, then leave it there for the duration. Won't help for shallow DOF shots, of course.

<h2 class=Spacer><a name="LCD">The LCD</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>Since the E-P1 lives and dies by its LCD, the quality and usability of the LCD are critical issues. Unlike the LCDs on recent premium dSLRs which sport 900,000 dot 3 inch LCDs, the E-P1's LCD is 3 inches but "only" 230,000 dots. As several astute observers have suggested this may be due to the need to maximize refresh speed to accommodate live view plus the need to keep power consumption to a minimum, given the smallish battery and the number of power-consuming sub-systems. 

<p>We do know the E-P1's LCD is viewable at extreme angles, which partly offsets the lack of any sort of hinge system. Opinions vary widely from those who have used the camera whether it is bright enough to handle midday sunlight. Ian Burley of fourthirdsuser.com, who used the camera for several hours <a href="http://fourthirds-user.com/2009/06/olympus_pen_ep1_initial_handson_review.php">writes</a>: 

<p class=Navy>"the screen coped well in the bright midday sunlight we were bathed in".

<p>Vlatko Juric-Kokic <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/06/the-ep1-not-exactly-what-you-want.html">agrees</a>: 

<p class=Navy>"The adverse photographing conditions in Berlin, though, showed me that the LCD on E-P1 can be used in the sun."

<p>Both are saying the LCD is <b><i>usable</i></b> in bright daylight, they are not saying that it is <b><i>enjoyable</i></b>. Also, midday sunlight is not necessarily the worst conditions for an LCD; when the sun is low and behind you, the LCD acts like a mirror and becomes totally useless unless you can shade it with your hand or similar.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="Exposure">Exposure control</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>Like any modern dSLR, the E-P1 has a rich set of exposure controls. Some highlights include:

<ul>
<li>ESP, Olympus' multi-metering algorithm uses 324 segments
<li>The 2% spot meter can be configured for highlight or shadow priority
<li>The exposure compensation range is +/- 3 stops in 1/3, 1/2, and 1 stop increments
<li>Three frame exposure bracketing can be configured for 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 stop increments.
</ul>

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: For <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/expose-right.shtml">ETTR</a> metering try using highlight priority spot plus AE lock off the brightest part of the scene.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="AFspeed">Auto focus and AF speed</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>The E-P1 has the usual set of dSLR AF features. You can select from 11 focus points and the point you've selected is bracketed by a green box on the LCD. Half-pressing the shutter release activates the AF; there is an AE/AF lock button, single frame and continuous frame shooting modes, etc. 

<p>The main difference between the E-P1's AF and that of dSLRs is that the E-P1 uses contrast detection AF just as point&shoots do, while dSLRs use phase detection AF. Contrast detection AF is in general somewhat slower than phase detection; but Panasonic made a breakthrough in contrast detect speed as premiered in their G1 and GH1 cameras.

<p>Simon Joinson writes in his <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/previews/olympusep1/page9.asp">Preview</a> (page 9):

<p class=Navy>"Unfortunately Panasonic didn't share that technology with Olympus, and the E-P1 uses essentially the same focus system as cameras such as the E-620, meaning that it feels sluggish even compared to most compacts (that said, we're playing with a very early IP (initial production) unit here - without the final firmware - so will reserve judgment until we've got the finished product).

<p class=Navy>"The focus speed certainly feels a little (but not a lot) faster than the CD-AF on, say, the E-620, thanks we'd imagine to the faster TruePic V processor and optimized lenses, but it's not a patch on Panasonic's system, and in low light at the long end of the zoom is pretty painful."

<p>This is affirmed by Jeff Keller in his <a href="http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/olympus/e_p1-review/using">First Look</a>, as well. But writing later on the dpreview forum Simon Joinson <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1022&message=32148410">adds</a>:

<p class=Navy>"The AF on the later firmware version we used was better, but this is still an early lens and the lens appears to have quite an impact. One thing i can tell you is that AF speed on this camera is much better with Panasonic's micro four thirds zooms than the Olympus 14-42 we've got (i've just been out shooting with the 14-140mm)."

<p>And Ian Burley of fourthirdsuser.com <a href="http://fourthirds-user.com/2009/06/olympus_pen_ep1_initial_handson_review.php">writes</a>:

<p class=Navy>"On paper, live view AF should struggle compared to the phase detect systems used in SLRs, but Panasonic proved that some solid engineering can really make the Micro Four Thirds live view AF experience quite similar to SLR AF. I think Olympus has done a good job with its two new Micro Four Thirds m.Zuiko Digital Zuiko lenses and their focus speed is definitely better than, say, the original Four Thirds 14-42 standard zoom."

<p>So:
<ul>
<li>a) AF speed clearly depends on the firmware in the lens,
<li>b) the firmware involved in preliminary reports was not production-ready, and
<li>c) even after the camera is released improvements could be issued via firmware updates.
</ul>


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="ManFocus">Manual focus</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>Turning the manual focus ring on an attached lens causes the E-P1 to instantly display an inset of a magnified view of the focus point on the LCD. This aids precision focusing. 

<p>One concern is that, given the E-P1's LCD is "only" 230,000 dots, it will prove too coarse for precision focusing or too difficult in harsh light conditions. Another concern is that too many steps may be needed to manually focus legacy lenses by eye. Until there is more information, those who prefer manual focus may may want to consider that the E-P1 <i>may</i> prove to be optimized more for AF than MF shooting.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="LensCompat">Lens compatibilities</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p class=Centered><IMG SRC="E-P1_lineup_rdax_430x210.jpg" width=430 height=210 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 5: Olympus promo shot: E-P1 with lenses, adapter and flash

<p>At present the E-P1 is directly compatible with:

<ul>
<li>Its companion micro four thirds 14-42 zoom (28-84, 35mm equiv.) and 17mm (34, 35mm equiv.) primes
<li>Micro four thirds lens from Panasonic
</ul>

<p>And is compatible via adaptors with:

<ul>
<li>All standard four thirds lenses from Olympus and Panasonic (MMF-1 adapter)
<li>All (manual focus) OM lenses (MF-2 adapter)
</ul>

<p>And will undoubtedly have an M mount adapter available in future. 

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Note</b>: Due to the micro four thirds' FOV, all M mount and OM mount lenses will crop to 2x their rated focal lengths. So, for example, a 24 mm lens will have the equivalent field of view as a 48 mm. 


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="Shutter">Shutter sound</a></h2>

<p>The E-P1 has the same shutter mechanism as the Panasonic G1 and GH1, so it also has a similar muted but not silent shutter activation click, as can be heard on <a href="http://www.fourthirdsphoto.com/e-p1Preview/05.php">this</a> page.

<p class=IvoryBoxCentered><b>Disclaimer</b>: I know very little about video capture; any contributions to this area would be much appreciated!

<p>The E-P1 has up to 720p MPEG AVI video capture: 1280 x 720 (up to 7 minutes per file) and 640 x 480 (up to 14 minutes per file) at 30 frames per second. Maximum single file size is 2 GB. This includes stereo sound capture in Wave Format Base, PCM/16bit, 44.1kHz. Many of the camera's still features are enabled for sound, including aperture priority, single AF, and even the art filters (which reportedly slow the frame rate). 

<p>Quite a few sample videos are available from the preview links above.

<p>The E-P1 has no built-in flash; instead an Olympus flash gun or the optional FL-14 hot-shoe flash may be purchased. But note that the FL-14 has no tilt capability. Flash sync speed is 180th/sec.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: Olympus promo: E-P1 sample photo

<p>The critical thing about the E-P1 is that it uses a dSLR-sized sensor that is several times larger than the sensors found in compact cameras. This means it can collect several times as much light per exposure as a compact camera, which is particularly important in low light situations. 

<p>Next, the E-P1 is a 12 megapixel camera, which is a good general compromise between resolution and low light handling. While the E-P1's sensor is only half the size of a 35mm film frame, like any recent 12 mp dSLR it has all the resolution and nuance capabilities of at least a 645 medium format camera loaded with fine-grain colour film. 

<p>Evaluating image quality, however, tends to be a divisive issue. In part this is because there are many elements involved that are purely subjective, such as colour accuracy and contrast; but it's also because some people shoot JPEGs &ndash; which depend entirely on the camera's JPEG engine &ndash; and some people shoot raw. Raw output is not usable until converted in software on a computer, and each of the many different conversion programs can produce very different results from the same raw image file.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="IQrawnoise">IQ - raw noise</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>While the E-P1's sensor (technically known as 4/3 size) is several times larger than any sensor used in a point&shoot compact camera, it is also somewhat smaller than the (APS-C) sensors used in most other dSLRs. 4/3 sensors in general have a reputation for higher noise levels purely on the theoretical grounds of their necessarily smaller per-pixel light capturing area for a given megapixel count. However, noise has as much to do with the percentage of the pixel area used for light capture, circuitry insulation, and other technical considerations as it does with sheer pixel size.

<p>Thanks to the excellent <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/EP1/EP1THMB.HTM">raw image files</a> posted at Imaging-Resource.com, we already know that the E-P1's sensor and image processing circuitry are essentially identical to those used in the Olympus E-30 dSLR. This means that the E-P1's underlying image noise characteristics are also essentially identical to the E-30's. 

<p>You can see that the E-30 (and therefore the E-P1) holds up very nicely against both Canon and Nikon APS-C dSLRs in this hardware-level <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/eng/Image-Quality-Database/Compare-cameras/(appareil1)/267|0/(appareil2)/295|0/(appareil3)/315|0/(onglet)/0/(brand)/Canon/(brand2)/Nikon/(brand3)/Olympus">comparison</a> from DxO (click on the SNR tab). 

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: (courtesy W. Gordon Goodsman, electronics engineer) To verify raw noise levels for yourself, simply download the Imaging-Resource.com <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/EP1/EP1THMB.HTM">raw files</a> at various ISOs from the E-P1 and other cameras, download the excellent freeware <a href="">FastStone</a> imaging software, then use it to convert the raw files with zero noise reduction to create a level playing field. In FastStone make sure you have the <b>High-quality color interpolation</b> option on the RAW settings tab checked.)

<h2 class=Spacer><a name="IQjpegnoise">IQ - JPEG noise</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>The E-P1 uses the newly developed TruePic V signal processor, which generates the camera's JPEG image output. JPEG shooters are already proclaiming that TruePic V does a significantly better job of juggling noise reduction, detail retention, and colour retention, than any of its predecessors. 

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: Judge for yourself using Imaging-Resource.com's excellent <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/IMCOMP/COMPS01.HTM">Comparometer</a>.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="IQres">IQ - resolution</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>The E-P1 has a weaker anti-aliasing (low pass) filter than the E-30, so it should weigh in with better resolution numbers than the E-30's and at least equal to those of the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcg1/page32.asp">Panasonic G1</a>, which is very good indeed.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="IQDR">IQ - dynamic range</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Tech talk</b>: <b>Dynamic range</b> (DR), also called exposure latitude, is the range from darkest to brightest portions of the scene a camera can capture. 

<p>Given how similar the E-P1's sensor is to the E-30's, it should behave very similarly in this area. As E-30 reviews show, the E-30's DR is quite typical of dSLRs and significantly better than compacts, weighing in at over <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympuse30/page24.asp">8 stops</a> for JPEG capture.


<h2 class=Spacer><a name="IQcolour">IQ - colour</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->

<p>Preview samples show the E-P1's colour capture is fully as nuanced as any modern dSLR. Colour accuracy is more a matter of JPEG settings or the internal camera profile used by the raw converter than an intrinsic property of the camera.
