<p>This guide aims to provide essential purchase decision information about the E-P1 in as succinct and as usable a format as possible. There is already plenty of information (and even more mis-information) available for those trying to make an informed purchase or pre-order decision. Once it ships an added focus will be tips and tricks for using it.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>(27 Jul)</b>: Shut down due to lack of interest. Content may no longer be up-to-date.

<!--p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>(06 Jul)</b>: I now have my own E-P1 and 14-42 zoom and have made a few changes throughout this document based on my own findings, particularly regarding LCD usability and AF speed.
<p>When finally officially announced in mid-June, the Olympus E-P1 &ndash; nay: the very thought of the camera, since it wasn't even available for purchase &ndash; took the photography world by storm. Based on the sheer number of page hits, forum posts, previews and first looks, etc., I can't recall that any camera has ever generated such an explosive level of initial interest. While one might with normal prudence wait for the camera to ship and be reviewed before making a go/no-go purchase decision, in the case of the E-P1 it is already so heavily pre-ordered that it could well be a question how many months one will have to wait for orders placed today, let alone a few months from now.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox>This is a work in progress and hopefully a community effort. If you have corrections, suggestions, or material to add please e-mail me at webmaster@daystarvisions.com. I attribute all material used unless you ask to remain anonymous. I'm trying to maximize objectivity, minimize personal bias, and have no ulterior motivation here except to provide a service to the photographic community. -->

You can read his on-going review diary <a href="http://www.ukphotosafari.org/e-p1-team-review/?currentPage=2">here</a>.

<h2 class=Spacer><a name="Summary"></a>Help! Too much, too technical, I just want to decide!</h2>
<!-- ====================== -->
<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 06 Jul)

<p>The E-P1 crams a dSLR sensor and electronics into the smallest possible package, making it somewhat larger and somewhat heavier than the typical point&shoot compact, but significantly smaller than the smallest dSLR.

<p>If you're coming to the E-P1 as an <b>upgrade to a compact camera</b>, you'll pay more but get better image quality, the ability to shoot indoors without flash, a big bright LCD, excellent video capture, the option to use other lenses than the one you bought it with, and the (optional) dSLR-like ability to control all aspects of the camera's operation.

<p>If you're coming to the E-P1 as a <b>traveling companion to your dSLR</b>, you may miss the peer-through viewfinder, although the E-P1's LCD is in fact usable in bright daylight and at acute viewing angles. It's auto-focus is similar in speed to that of compacts, slower than most dSLRs (but not as slow as typical dSLR live view AF). The E-P1 is compatible with all existing four thirds mount lenses, plus OM and M mount lenses via adapter; and as a major bonus, all lenses are image-stabilized because Olympus uses sensor-based, not lens-based IS. The E-P1 also has a full dSLR-level control and features set.

<!--p class=IvoryBoxCentered><b>Availability</b>: limited quantities July 3rd in Japan, elsewhere depending on transit times.-->

<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 24 Jul. Since E-P1 prices are unlikely to fall below MSRP until the supply chain saturates, the table below should be accurate for some time to come.)

<p class=SmallishNoteNavy><b>(21 Jul)</b>: Availability note. There have been many increasingly-concerned posts on online photography forums, such as <a href="">dpreview.com's</a>, wondering when the white E-P1 will be available in a given sales region. The following is informed speculation, based on previous experience in retail and the few available facts: 

<p class=SmallishNoteNavy>I strongly suspect the only person who can answer that question is an Olympus production manager somewhere in Tokyo who probably doesn't speak a word of English. We know that pre-orders and orders of the E-P1 went right off the charts. I've read that B&H alone has 5000 orders to fill. But cameras and lenses roll off assembly lines one unit at a time; and production logistics were very likely tailored to only a fraction of that number. 

<p class=SmallishNoteNavy>Reading between the lines, my guess is that there is only one assembly line; that it did a smallish run of white bodies before the official announcement and before anyone could know how well the somewhat-daring white model would be received, then switched back to production of the safer silver model. A number of that first run of whites went out to the various regional Olympus teams as demos, all or most of the rest apparently went to Olympus Asia. Another run of whites may even have already been done and are sitting somewhere in cargo containers. 

<p class=SmallishNoteNavy>If my analysis is correct, then all this means that: 
<ul>
<li class=SmallNavy>A) pre-dominantly silver+14-42s kits will dribble in to the wholesale chain in each region &ndash; there will not be enough to satisfy requests for any E-P1 kits for some months to come. 
<li class=SmallNavy>B) a small number of white kits will reach each Olympus sales region (Europe, NA, Asia, etc.) sometime in the fairly near future, to be snapped up by the biggest accounts, such as B&H, Jessops, etc. 
<li class=SmallNavy>C) production will finally meet or exceed demand in time for Christmas.
<li class=SmallNavy>D) the same scarcity of white models will also apply to the pancake, body-only, and duo kits.
<li class=SmallNavy>E) price reductions won't kick in until Christmas or just after.

<p>The E-P1 is one of only three cameras made (along with the Sigma DP1 and DP2) that share its design characteristics:

<li>Large, dSLR-level, sensor inside (E-P1's sensor is 4/3" in Fig. 3)
<li>No peer-through viewfinder: back LCD monitor only
<li>Usable with a variety of lenses (interchangeable lens mount like an SLR).

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Tech talk</b>: The E-P1 belongs to a family of <a href="http://www.four-thirds.org/en/microft/"><b>micro four thirds</b></a> (&#956;43) cameras that also includes the Panasonic G1 and GH1, but micro four thirds does not completely specify the E-P1, since micro four/thirds has nothing to say about what sort of viewfinder is used (other than eliminating the possibility of a mirror-based SLR-style finder). 

<p>The E-P1 is neither an SLR, nor a TLR, nor a rangefinder, nor a point&shoot compact, nor a view camera. One might call the E-P1 a <b>large-sensor compact (LSC)</b>, to introduce a new term for a new category of camera.

<!-- ====================== -->

<p>We can only guess, but I see Olympus as having several different target audiences for this camera. Some will buy it for its capabilities; others will be taken in by its sheer good looks and buy it as a retro chic fashion statement. The His and Hers colour schemes and accessory carrying cases are for the later demographic.

<h3>Fashion and fun</h3>

<p class=Centered><img src="Pix/E-P1_silver_17mm_people_1_rdax_450x325.jpg" width=450 height=325 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 4: Olympus promo shot

<p>Much of the promo material (Fig. 3) targets this demographic, as do the scene modes, art filters, and the full auto option on the mode dial. The larger sensor's ability to work in low light combined with image stabilization actually make this a better camera for indoor, bar, concert, etc. than any purse-sized point&shoot. Also: the combination of art filter and video is just the sort of thing that could catch on as a significant fad.

<h3>Mom & Pop travel plus special occasions</h3>

<p><b>Outdoors</b>: The LCDs on point&shoot compact digitals are notoriously difficult to see in bright daylight as any point&shoot, but that doesn't seem to phase the thousands of tourists the swarm over the Grand Canyon's vantage points every day. The E-P1 is probably too much camera for this type of shooting for this demographic, but it certainly can't hurt, and its HyperCrystal LCD technology makes for one of the best displays going.

<p><b>Indoors</b>: Many museums, and historical sites, such as churches, forbid the use of flashes. The E-P1's combination of image stabilization plus usable ISOs as high as 3200 solves this problem. This also makes for better indoor event shots, such as at birthday parties, since it eliminates the artificiality of flash lighting, and red-eye too.

<h3>SLR substitute for hiking and travel</h3>

<p>The image quality is there. The size and weight are great. Can you live without a peer-through finder and with less-than-stellar auto-focus speed?

<h3>RF substitute for street/candids/snaps, especially low-light</h3>

<p>This may be the ideal purposing for this camera. The E-P1 looks like a tourist p&s, is used like a tourist p&s, and puts strangers at ease like a tourist p&s. As a bonus, the combination of in-camera image stabilization plus reasonable image quality at higher ISOs means candids can also be taken indoors without flash.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: Anyone who has ever done <b>street or candids</b> with a digital p&s will have realized that doing so takes inconspicuousness to a whole new level. Any camera you hold to your eye marks you as a serious shooter and immediately makes people <a href="http://daystarvisions.com/Docs/Rvws/OlyPen/Aware_of_SLR-sz500x476.jpg">self-conscious</a>. Put a black SLR to your eye and you may as well be aiming a howitzer. In contrast, people assume that anyone who is holding a smallish camera <a href="http://daystarvisions.com/Docs/Rvws/OlyPen/PnS-sz500x474.jpg">out at arm's length</a> to frame is taking amateur vacation/family snapshots and is therefore either focused on family members or some building or other aspect of the scenery, just as they themselves would be doing in the same circumstances.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: Olympus promo shot: E-P1 back view

<p>Let's get this out of the way right off the top:

<p><b>If you need a peer-into finder with critical focus capability for the type of shooting you do, look elsewhere.</b>

<p>At least half of the initial reaction to this camera has been protestations and indignation over the lack of a viewfinder. Panasonic already has two micro 4/3 cameras with viewfinders (G1 and GH1); Olympus has one in development. Samsung has the APS-C NX. Leica has the M8.2 rangefinder. These cameras are not noticeably smaller than the smallest dSLRs, such as the Canon Rebel series and the Olympus E-450 and E-620. So it's really very simple:

<p><b>The E-P1 has the same LCD-only viewing capability as a typical point & shoot and can be used in the same way and under the same conditions.</b>

<p>The reason there's been so much indignation over the E-P1 is that photographers <i>really</i> want a camera as small as the E-P1 but with complete dSLR functionality and IQ. That's simply not possible with today's technology nor is it likely to be for years to come. Here are some roads not taken with the E-P1:
<ul>
<li>Yes: Olympus could have stuck a little <b>tunnel finder</b> in the E-P1 just as they have done in so many of their point&shoot compact digitals. Such finders have between 80% and 85% coverage, parallax issues, and no focusing facilities. 
<li>Implementing a true <b>range finder</b> would have made the camera as big as a Leica M, added enormously to the selling price, and still suffered from parallax and unsuitability with long focal lengths. Plus: Mike Johnston makes the <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/06/finding-the-view-and-zooming-it-too.html">excellent point</a> that rangefinders and zoom lenses don't mix.
<li>A <b>miniature EVF</b> might be feasible but the complaints would have been as endless as the compromises inherent in its design. Battery drain would have been a further issue. As well, I suspect Olympus simply didn't have a prime-time EVF that would have been available in time for this camera.
</ul>

<p>Instead, Olympus provides a hot-shoe <b>optical finder</b> (VF-4) for the 17mm prime, and will presumably do so for each micro 4/3 prime they release in the future. Again: these lack focus facility and parallax issues but provide a far bigger image and coverage than a tunnel finder. 

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: channeled from my paternal grandfather who used an 8x10 view camera for his entire working career. Stuff a light-weight <b>dark cloth</b> in your pocket and drape it over your head when shooting in bright light. Alternately, substitute a poncho, jacket, or cape. OK: maybe not the best idea for street work. ;)

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: if using the <b>hot-shoe finder</b> <i>(June 22:) together with a lens with a distance scale</i>, calculate the <b>hyperfocal distance</b> for your favourite f/stop for the focal length of the lens you're using, dial in that distance on the LCD, then leave it there for the duration. Won't help for shallow DOF shots, of course.

<p class=LightBlueBox><b>Correction (21 Jun)</b>: <i>Please elaborate: is there a distance scale on the LCD? Cheers, <b>Ukko Heikkinen</b></i><br><br>

<b>(22 Jun) </b>Thanks, Ukko: I stupidly assumed there would be, just because there is one on my Lumix LX1 and some other cameras I've used. But reading the E-30 manual, there is no such feature for that camera, so presumably not for the E-P1 either. There will of course be a distance scale on most 35mm prime lenses, but there certainly isn't one on the 17mm pancake &ndash; DC.

<p class=LightBlueBox><b>Hint (22 Jun)</b>: Thanks to <b>Swingline</b>, who reports: I use the <a href="http://hoodmanusa.com/prodinfo.asp?number=H-LPP3">Hoodman Hoodloupe</a> when I can't see the LCD. It hangs from a rubber string around your neck. You need to shoot with one hand if you don't want to attach it in some makeshift way.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 7: half-frame glasses solve a frequent LCD complaint

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: Many photographers over forty have excellent eye sight for distance work but need glasses for close work (presbyopia). Uncorrected, this makes using camera LCDs a chore &ndash you have to either continually swap reading glasses on and off or hold the camera out at full arm's length. <b>Half-frame glasses</b> can be left on and simply overlooked for distance viewing.<br><br>

Because the E-P1's LCD can be seen clearly from off-angles, you can then work by holding the camera just below eye level with elbows against ribs for stability. The trick here is to set focus, exposure, and zoom first, compose the shot by looking out into the world, then glance down at the camera to check that the camera is framing what you want it to. Like riding a bicycle, it soon becomes second nature. (As a bonus, a sufficiently retro version of half-frame can make one look harmless and avuncular &ndash; a bit of Clark Kent disguise to your Superman powers &ndash; to put people at ease.)

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>(06 Jul)</b>: It's hard to judge a camera's size from any number of pictures, but no: this is not the magic miniature pocket-cam with dSLR image quality dSLR owners have been dreaming of. The IQ is there, but in size and heft you're better off thinking of it as a somewhat smaller Leica M or as the 35mm compact you or your family happily used in previous decades. It's a camera you can stuff into a little shoulder bag then sling over your shoulders to carry around all day without noticing the weight.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 8: Olympus promo shot: Silver E-P1 front view

<p>As you can see from <a href="#Spec">Fig. 2</a> above, the E-P1's body is internally some sort of polycarbonate clad with a combination of stainless steel and aluminum plates. All-metal construction has been increasingly rare since the 1980s, so even metal plating puts the E-P1 in an elite stratum of classiness.

<p><b>Dimensions</b>: 120mm by 70.6 mm by 36.4 mm (4.7" x 2.7" x 1.4"), which is somewhat larger than a typical modern compact, and weighs 335 gm + 72 gm for the battery or 407 gm (14 oz) without lens. The kit 14-42 zoom adds 150 gm (5.3 oz) and the kit 17 mm pancake adds 71 gm (2.5 oz).

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 9: Olympus promo shot: White E-P1 top view

<p>The silver version has brushed stainless steel wrapping around the body. <!--Chris Lulic, who had some hands-on time with the E-P1 at a public showing, writes:

<p class=BrownBold>The silver's shiny brushed aluminum mid body area scratches too easily. The display models where all showing light scratches but the white one was not. To be fair, a deeper scratch would probably stand out more on the white one.

<p-->The stainless steel of the white version is painted with an enamel-like gloss so should clean well. Both versions have aluminum tops and bottoms. Some of the trim is chrome-plated.

<p>Notice in Fig. 8 that the mode dial on the left is recessed to prevent the perennial problem with compact cameras of the mode dial's setting being changed by catching in pocket or bag. On the right the now-familiar hand grip is reduced to a raised leatherette rectangle, but the back right edge has a raised lip, so the two combined should provide quite a bit of security for hand-holding. 

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox>I find the green LED glow around the on/off button something of an avoidable anachronism to the retro styling. The on/off button can still be pressed if the entire area is covered with square of opaque tape.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 11: Olympus BLS-1 battery and BCS-1 charger

<p>The E-P1 accepts the slim, 72 gram, Olympus BLS-1 1150 mAh Li-on rechargeable battery. The camera ships with the BLS-1 plus the BCS-1 charger. (Same combination used for the Olympus E-420 and E-620 dSLRs.)

<p>The small body size of this camera compared to the typical dSLR put a tight constraint on the size battery that could be used (which in turn undoubtedly put a tight constraint on the power drain of all components used). We frequently see cameras plus batteries rated as 300 or 500 exposures; Olympus rates the E-P1 + BLS-1 for 300 exposures. My own experience and that of several others is that 200 exposures would be a better estimate. If you foresee using the E-P1 for all-day shooting, I'd strongly recommend a spare battery. The BLS-1 is extremely expensive, but so far the camera does work with third-party substitutes.

<p class=LightBlueBox><b>Hint (27 Jun)</b>: to conserve battery power Brian Mosley suggests setting the Fn button to <b>Backlit LCD</b> off (see instructions in <a href="http://www.olympus.co.jp/en/support/imsg/digicamera/download/manual/pen/man_ep1_e.pdf">manual</a>, page 100) and notes that MF likely uses power more sparingly than AF.

<h2 class=Spacer><a name="LCD">The LCD</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->
<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 06 Jul)

<p>Since the E-P1 lives and dies by its LCD, the quality and usability of the LCD are critical issues. Unlike the LCDs on recent premium dSLRs which sport 900,000 dot 3 inch LCDs, the E-P1's LCD is 3 inches but "only" 230,000 dots. <!--As several astute observers have suggested this may be due to the need to maximize refresh speed to accommodate live view plus the need to keep power consumption to a minimum, given the smallish battery and the number of power-consuming sub-systems.-->

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Update (29 Jun)</b>: Akira Watanabe, product planning manager of Olympus's SLR division, <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lemondedelaphoto.com%2FEntre-chat-a-propos-de-l-Olympus%2C2341.html&sl=fr&tl=en&history_state0=">informs us</a> that the 230K LCD was chosen because it is brighter, and so handles daylight better, than higher res screens. Reading between the lines: this does not necessarily imply that the E-P1's LCD is brighter than all competing screens. Olympus uses HyperCrystal for its excellent viewing angle; the 230K version is apparently the brightest of the HyperCrystal options.

<p>On the upside we do know the E-P1's LCD is viewable at extreme angles, which partly offsets the lack of any sort of hinge system. The LCD is <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_hyper_crystal.asp">HyperCrystal</a>, "meaning the LCD utilizes an additional layer that reflects light from any external light source &ndash; both indoors and outdoors - to enhance the brightness of the LCD ... even in direct sunlight". (I can find no information as to which generation of HyperCrystal is involved. The official specs simply say "HyperCrystal" even though other Olympus E system cameras are listed as using HyperCrystal III.)

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Update (06 Jul)</b>: Having now used the E-P1 for many hours in <b>full midday sunlight</b>, I can report that the LCD is in fact viewable in even such hostile lighting. You can see it well enough to frame, to read all setting and menu information, and to manual focus at least fairly well. Colours, however, are somewhat washed out under these conditions; and the contrast between light and dark is exaggerated. Simply bump up the screen brightness (on the set-up menu) before using the camera in bright daylight, then turn it back down when done.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Update (16 Jul)</b>: another caveat is that the E-P1's live view does <b>not work in extremely dim light</b>. As with any other live view, the image on the LCD becomes increasingly coarse/grainy as light levels drop. Church interiors and bar scenes, however, are fine.

<!-- ====================== -->
<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 11 Jul)

<p>Like any modern dSLR, the E-P1 has a rich set of exposure controls. Some highlights include:

<ul>
<li>ESP, Olympus' multi-metering algorithm uses 324 segments
<li>The 2% spot meter can be configured for highlight or shadow priority
<li>The exposure compensation range is +/- 3 stops in 1/3, 1/2, and 1 stop increments
<li>Three frame exposure bracketing can be configured for 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 stop increments.
</ul>

<!--p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint</b>: For <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/expose-right.shtml">ETTR</a> metering try using highlight priority spot plus AE lock off the brightest part of the scene.-->

<p>Perhaps most importantly: thanks to live view, a very nifty little histogram can be left on-screen. This instantly responds both to the changing light and to any changes you make using exposure compensation, shutter, aperture, etc. A live histogram can be found on some compacts; the difference here is that having two dials with which to directly control exposure settings makes this a very practical feature to use.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Hint (11 Jul)</b>: Here's the <a href="http://daystarvisions.com/Docs/Ref/E-P1/Config1.html">set-up</a> I currently use to configure my E-P1 for general action photography, as in children at play, pets, etc.

<!-- ====================== -->
<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 11 Jul)

<p>The E-P1 has the usual set of dSLR AF features. You can select from 11 focus points and the point you've selected is bracketed by a green box on the LCD. Half-pressing the shutter release activates the AF; there is an AE/AF lock button, single frame and continuous frame shooting modes, etc. 

<p>The main difference between the E-P1's AF and that of dSLRs is that the E-P1 uses contrast detection AF just as point&shoots do, while dSLRs use phase detection AF. Contrast detection AF is in general somewhat slower than phase detection; but Panasonic made a breakthrough in contrast detect speed as premiered in their G1 and GH1 cameras.

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>Imaging Resource's <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/EP1/EP1A6.HTM">performance testing</a> of the E-P1 with kit lens measures AF focus as taking approximately 1 second. Indications are performance for the 17mm pancake lens and legacy lenses via adapter are very similar. On the other hand, the (extremely expensive) Panasonic micro 4/3 14-140 zoom is dramatically faster when used with the E-P1. This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWwPGLQr5tg">YouTube demonstration</a> by Brian Mosley gives a very idea what the E-P1's focus performance feels like in use. 

<p>This speed is of course slow by modern SLR standards (SLRs use a different AF technology that depends on the SLR design) and typical of compact cameras. While no particular problem for many types of shooting, when dealing with moving subjects, including sports, children, wildlife, and pets, camera response is very definitely an issue. The trick here is to configure the E-P1 from the default to only re-focusing when required. Here's how: 

<p class=LightBlueBox><b>Hint (23 Jun)</b>: Thanks to <b>Brian Mosley</b>: <a href="http://www.ukphotosafari.org/e-p1-team-review/2009/6/23/how-to-get-maximum-speed-from-e-p1-cdaf.html">How to get Maximum Speed from AF</a> (be sure to set the AEL button to AF-S in the cog menu, as well). See also <b>my own <a href="http://daystarvisions.com/Docs/Ref/E-P1/Config1.html">set-up</a></b> for more information.

<p>This set-up frees you to make optimal use of the E-P1's excellent shutter lag (or lack there of). Combine this with a narrow aperture (F/6.3 is ideal) for maximum depth of field to minimize the number of re-focus events required.

<h3>Auto focus accuracy</h3>

<p>The familiar phase detect AF used in dSLRs is fast, but especially in low light or with low contrast subjects it can hunt and eventually fail to lock. After careful comparisons between a very recent Olympus dSLR (the E-620) and the E-P1, swapping the same lenses between them in low light, Brian Mosley finds that in many cases the E-P1 actually out-performs the E-620. His write-up is <a href-"http://www.ukphotosafari.org/e-p1-team-review/2009/6/25/quick-update-before-leaving-for-london-premiere.html">here</a>.

<!-- ====================== -->
<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 28 Jun)

<p>Turning the manual focus ring on an attached 4/3 lens causes the E-P1 to instantly display an inset of a magnified view of the focus point on the LCD. This aids precision focusing. 

<p>One concern is that, given the E-P1's LCD is "only" 230,000 dots, it will prove too coarse for precision focusing or too difficult in harsh light conditions. Another concern is that too many steps may be needed to manually focus legacy lenses by eye. Until there is more information, those who prefer manual focus may may want to consider that the E-P1 <i>may</i> prove to be optimized more for AF than MF shooting.

<p class=LightBlueBox><b>Update (28 Jun)</b>: Thanks to <a href="http://johnmcd.zenfolio.com/"><b>John McDonough</b></a> for this input on manual focusing. John handled the EP-1 at the PMA in Australia:<br><br>

<b>My main mission was to see how it manually focused with an OM lens. None of the reps had any idea but they did have a E-P1 with a 50/1.8 attached in a show case along with an original Pen and they allowed me to use it.<br><br>

With that lens on and using the LCD without magnifying, it was very easily evident when it was sharp just as it would be focusing with a matte screen and no split image aid on my old OM1. Couldn't try it outside, but inside it was VERY usable in my opinion. I found I could rotate the familiar OM lens and have it visually snap into focus on the screen and that was wide open.</b><br><br>

(More <a href="http://www.rangefinderforum.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=76151">here</a>).

<p>John's report jives well with Brian Mosley's. I asked him: is the 230K LCD too coarse for accurate MF focus in good light? Brian <a href="http://www.ukphotosafari.org/e-p1-team-review/2009/6/22/cdaf-focusing-speed-lcd-gotchas.html">responded</a>:

<p class=BrownBold>Definitely not. MF is possible, even without zooming into the 10x live view magnification in most situations - the screen sometimes has a critical focus 'glimmer' when focusing on something like cloth with a fine texture.

<!--p>While reports are that the LCD is usable in bright daylight, I'm suspect manual focus shooters will share my scepticism that the above good news will also stand up to the harsh light of day.-->

<h2 class=Spacer><a name="Lag">Shutter lag</a></h2>
<!-- ====================== -->
<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 26 Jul)

<p>As reported in the AF section above, the E-P1's AF time is roughly 1 sec., depending on the lens and particular settings used. If you use AF or MF to pre-focus, the camera's response time from full depressing the shutter release until the exposure is actually made is called its pre-focused shutter lag. Imaging-Resource's <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/EP1/EP1A6.HTM">review</a> reports the E-P1's pre-focus lag as 0.072 sec. and notes: 

<p class=BrownBold>The E-P1's prefocused lag time of 0.072s is quite fast though, besting some SLRs in its general price range. That's partially because there is no mirror to move out of the way first.

<p>It's quite interesting to test your own camera's lag, using the clever on-screen <a href="http://www.shooting-digital.com/columns/schwartz/shutter_release_test/default.asp">test page</a> at Shooting Digital. My results concur with Imaging-resources in that over multiple trials I'm seeing between 0.05 and 0.1 sec. pre-focused lag with the E-P1 and am unable to get under 0.1 with my dSLR. Also note that the E-P1's lag is essentially identical to the Leica M8 but all are still left in the dust by the 35mm Leica M series. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_lag">this</a> Wikipedia page for details.)

<p>(<b>Screen lag</b>: There has been mention on-line that, because the E-P1 uses Live View, there is a necessary processing lag between the time an image hits the sensor and the instant it is shown on the LCD. So if one sees a race horse's nose passing the finish line on the LCD, one is actually seeing it a fraction of a second later than the reality, which does not sound good for action-critical photography. But in fact, using the Shooting Digital test page we can easily see that the screen lag is the same 0.07 sec. interval as its pre-focus lag.)

All of them will work on E-P1. [Plus there's one PEN -> micro 4/3 adapter, but I don't remember where I saw it.]<br><br>

Just as a side note, all of the existing adapters to 4/3 will also work on E-P1 if you add them on the 4/3 -> micro 4/3 adapter. Yes, two adapters, but since they don't have glass in them, nothing bad will happen.

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Note</b>: Due to the micro four thirds' FOV, all M mount and OM mount lenses will crop to 2x their rated focal lengths. So, for example, a 24 mm lens will have the equivalent field of view as a 48 mm.

<h3>Distortion correction</h3>

<p>Panasonic created quite a bit of controversy on the web when people realized that numerical information regarding the kit lens recorded distortion correction numbers for that lens design in each raw file from the camera. Olympus is using the same or similar system with at least its new micro four thirds kit zoom.

<p>Fig. 12 shows an example of what certainly appears to be the embedded correction tables from an Imaging-Resource.com raw test file. The TruePic V image processor uses these numbers to eliminate distortions such as chromatic aberrations, barrel or pincushioning, and light fall-off in the JPEGs it produces for each frame. Any raw converter that contains the required logic can do the same thing.

<p class=SmallishNote>(Last update: 16 Jul)

<p>The E-P1 has the same default-open shutter mechanism as the Panasonic G1 and GH1, so it also has a similar muted but definitely not silent shutter activation click. It's much quieter than a traditional film SLR (<a href="http://thru-the-zuiko.blogspot.com/2009/06/e-p1-short-review.html">comparison</a>), noticeably quieter than a digital SLR (<a href="http://www.fourthirdsphoto.com/e-p1Preview/05.php">comparison</a>), noticeably quieter than a Leica M (<a href="http://www.imaginginsider.com/?p=96492">comparison</a>), but not silent. 

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Update (29 Jun)</b>: many had hoped both the G1 and now the E-P1 would have a silent electronic (or lens-based?) shutter like digital compacts do instead of a mechanical shutter.

<p class=IvoryBoxCentered><b>Disclaimer</b>: I know very little about video capture; any contributions to this area would be much appreciated!

<p>The E-P1 has up to 720p MPEG AVI video capture: 1280 x 720 (up to 7 minutes per file) and 640 x 480 (up to 14 minutes per file) at 30 frames per second. Maximum single file size is 2 GB. This includes stereo sound capture in Wave Format Base, PCM/16bit, 44.1kHz. Many of the camera's still features are enabled for sound, including aperture priority, single AF (but the AF motor is audible!), and even the art filters (which reportedly slow the frame rate).

<p class=SimpleIvoryBox><b>Update (29 Jun)</b>: why doesn't the sensor-based image stabilization function during video recording?

In the same interview Mr. Watanabe also explained that the MPEG file format was chosen over formats with better compression because MPEG is supported by more software. 720p was chosen as the best fit for the E-P1, the higher res format being a better match to pro-level dedicated camcorders.<br><br>

He justifies the lack of external mic support due to Olympus' expertise in audio recording from its line of pocket audio recorders.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 15: E-P1 at the beach-->

<p>The critical thing about the E-P1 is that it uses a dSLR-sized sensor that is several times larger than the sensors found in compact cameras (see <a href="#WhatIsIt">Fig. 3</a>, above). This means it can collect several times as much light per exposure as a compact camera, which is particularly important in low light situations. 

<p>Next, the E-P1 is a 12 megapixel camera, which is a good general compromise between resolution and low light handling. While the E-P1's sensor is only half the size of a 35mm film frame, its image quality is quite comparable to typical recent 12 mp dSLRs in the resolution, noise, DR, and nuance. 

<p>Evaluating image quality, however, tends to be a divisive issue. In part this is because there are many elements involved that are purely subjective, such as colour accuracy and contrast; but it's also because some people shoot JPEGs &ndash; which depend entirely on the camera's JPEG engine &ndash; and some people shoot raw. Raw output is not usable until converted in software on a computer, and each of the many different conversion programs can produce very different results from the same raw image file.

<p>While the E-P1's sensor (technically known as 4/3 size) is several times larger than any sensor used in a point&shoot compact camera, it is also somewhat smaller than the (APS-C) sensors used in most other dSLRs. 4/3 sensors in general have a reputation for higher noise levels purely on the theoretical grounds of their necessarily smaller per-pixel light capturing area for a given megapixel count. However, noise has as much to do with the percentage of the pixel area used for light capture, circuitry insulation, and other technical considerations as it does with sheer pixel size.

<p>Thanks to the excellent <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/EP1/EP1THMB.HTM">raw image files</a> posted at Imaging-Resource.com, we already know that the E-P1's sensor and image processing circuitry are essentially identical to those used in the Olympus E-30 dSLR. This means that the E-P1's underlying image noise characteristics are also essentially identical to the E-30's. 

<p>You can see that the E-30 (and therefore the E-P1) holds up very nicely against both Canon and Nikon APS-C dSLRs in this hardware-level <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/eng/Image-Quality-Database/Compare-cameras/(appareil1)/267|0/(appareil2)/295|0/(appareil3)/315|0/(onglet)/0/(brand)/Canon/(brand2)/Nikon/(brand3)/Olympus">comparison</a> from DxO (click on the SNR tab).

<p>The E-P1's official image size is 4032x3024 or 12.3 mp. But due to its 4:3 aspect ratio, when considering resolution (and DOF), it's helpful to think of this as being a crop in width of a 14 mp APS-C dSLR frame, as shown in Fig. 21. 

<p>The E-P1 contains the same sensor but has a weaker anti-aliasing (low pass) filter than the E-30 (and most dSLRs), so it should weigh in with better resolution numbers than the E-30's and at least equal to those of the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcg1/page32.asp">Panasonic G1</a>, which is very good indeed for 12 mp. If you're familiar with the 14.6 mp Pentax K20D or the 15.1 mp Canon 50D or 500D, you can get a good idea of the E-P1's resolution by thinking of a 4:3 crop of an image from any those cameras but needing less USM to restore acutance.

<p>Now that production firmware E-P1s are in circulation, sample JPEG and RAW output demonstrate that the E-P1's colour capture is fully as nuanced as any modern dSLR. Colour accuracy is more a matter of JPEG settings or the internal camera profile used by the raw converter than an intrinsic property of the camera. That said, Olympus has something of a reputation for vibrant but tasteful out-of-camera JPEG colour; and the early word is that the E-P1 does not disappoint.
