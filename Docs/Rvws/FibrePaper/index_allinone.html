<p>Fig. 1: Some inkjet fibre papers</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Probably 98% of all digital photographs never get printed on paper. Of those that do get printed, at least 98% are printed on something called RC photo paper. Only a very small proportion get printed on any of the hundreds of high quality "art" papers that have exploded on to the scene in the past few years.</p>

<p>If you took a roll of 35mm film to your local micro-lab to have prints made a decade ago, you would normally have got back a set of 4x6 inch prints on a fairly glossy white paper with a plasticky feel and a surface texture composed of very tiny bumps. This is called <b>resin-coated photo paper</b>, or <b>RC</b> for short, and Fuji Crystal Archive happens to be the brand name of one of the most common products in that arena. RC is the culmination of many decades of refinement in photo paper. It's white colour and glossy surface are necessary to ensure that even the most contrasty, brilliantly coloured image is optimally reproduced. The plasticky, slick feel is the result, not of being made out of plastic, but of a pure chemical coating called polyethelene, that renders the paper highly resistant to scuffing, staining, and water damage. The artificially textured surface adds to its toughness, while helping break up reflections from the glossy sheen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you'd developed that roll of 35mm film yourself and set about printing it in a darkroom, you'd be more likely to use something called a fibre paper and obsess over choosing just the right air-dried surface texture and sheen. Fibre prints had a quality cachet that commercial RC prints lacked, but were delicate and meant to be handled carefully by experienced hands or framed. Darkroom fibre prints typically contained a baryta (barium sulfide) coating to whiten and buffer acidity.</p>

<p>This was the situation when photo quality inkjet printers appeared about a decade ago. The first and easiest task inkjet companies faced was to adapt film-purposed RC papers for inkjet printing; and this goal was met within the first few years. As inkjet printers evolved it gradually became apparent that the technology was maturing to at least equal the common darkroom and micro-lab technologies of the preceding film era. RC inkjet papers like Epson Premium Luster and Ilford Gallerie nicely handled the large demand for commercial-grade printing. What was needed was the equivalent of the darkroom fibre papers used for fine art photography.</p>

<p>The first stab at this was an attempt to adapt familiar matte surface papers from the watercolour painting world for use with inkjet printers. Many coatings were tried, and the results may well have been successful for the reproduction of watercolour paintings, but the results were less than satisfactory for general photography: black was charcoal grey, colours were less than vivid. Nevertheless, for a certain subset of photographic images the combination of matte finish and finely textured surfaces works very well indeed.</p>

<p>Only in the past five years has the challenge of creating the inkjet equivalent of an air-dried fibre print been seriousy addressed. This started when the first inkjet-compatible baryta coating was developed. We now have a dizzying panoply of fibre inkjet papers to choose from, and they have many of the characteristics of darkroom fibre papers, while retaining the excellent black and vivid colour reproduction of inkjet RC paper. The one characteristic of darkroom papers that remains to be addressed for many a darkroom veteran is the delicate surface texture often seen in darkroom prints.</p>

<h2><a name="Markets">Worlds in collision</a></h2>

<p>To my mind, the twin issues of paper colour and surface texture represents a battle ground between the paper mills and the world of painting-based galleries and collectors versus darkroom-experienced photographers plus the small subset of collectors with experience in this area versus amateur and new photographers. If you've only ever eaten McDonald's your first experience with European gourmet cooking may come as a shock, and not necessarily a pleasant shock. Similarly, if you grew up on European gourmet cooking then McDonald's will come as a shock, and is pretty much guaranteed not to be a pleasant one.</p>

<p>A paper mill like Arches, Hahnem&uuml;hle, Canson, Sihl, or Crane with centuries experience creating traditional watercolour papers has a certain bias towards what it believes a classy paper should look and feel like. Painting-based galleries and collectors very definitely share that bias. A manufacturer like Ilford or Kodak with decades of experience making darkroom photo paper has a certain and different bias towards what it believes a classy paper should look and feel like. A re-brander like Epson, HP, or Canon with no other experience except that of trying to read a market dominated by millions of amateurs shares their bias toward the technical perfection and artificiality of RC.</p>

<p>As a photographer, if you are trying to sell your work you need to learn to navigate in whichever of these very different waters you plan to sail in. Taking an RC print to an urban paintings-centric gallery or traditional collector is a waste of their and your time. Showing a cotton rag print at your local county fair or arts and crafts show is a waste of time and money. If you are <b><i>not</i></b> trying to sell your work, you need to stick to RC paper and not allow yourself to become corrupted by the money-sink of fine art materials. Hamburger is much less expensive a habit to indulge than filet mignon.</p>

<p>A nicely written polemic on this subject is Richard Lohmann's <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/surface-reflections.shtml">The Surface of Things</a>. (Bear in mind this was written in 2006; his criticisms of Silver Rag and Innova FibraPrint may long since have been addressed by the respective manufacturers.)</p>

<h2><a name="AboutSpecs">About the paper specs</a></h2>

<p>While the specs section below may seem a bit dry, it's all information that quickly becomes valuable when you become dissatisfied with the paper or papers you've been using then start researching which alternative would give you what you want. There's nothing particularly complex or difficult to understand about any of the information I'm presenting. The problem is the lack of its availability. A spec sheet like this one for <a href="http://www.hahnemuehle.com/media/photorag188_rev03.pdf">Hahnemuhle Photo Rag</a> is a valuable gem compared to this sorry specimen for <a href="http://www.inkpresspaper.com/profiles.asp?PaperID=42">Warm Tone Baryta</a> from rival Inkpress. It's not that a thorough spec sheet can tell you all you need to know before you buy an expensive box of paper; rather it tells you enough to eliminate whole swaths of products as not being appropriate to your particular needs. Similarly, on-line paper reviews would be hugely more valuable if their authors would assemble as much of the information as they can then include it in tabular form in their review.</p>

<p>A more difficult task for a reviewer is to try to give the reader a sense of the look and feel of a given paper. To say a paper has a pale buff colour and moderately toothy texture is better than nothing, but how to describe the difference in texture between two papers that both meet that description, such as Hahnemuhle Photo Rag Baryta and Inkpress Warm Tone Baryta? I've attempted to photograph the actual textures of the papers I'm reviewing, but the results are far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>Fig. 3: texture and colour</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>In Fig. 4, The top strip shows texture, below that paper colour. For reference I've included Epson Premium Luster as a typical OBA-whitened RC, and Moab Entrada Natural White as a typical non-OBA matte/watercolour paper. Be aware that your browser may not be showing you accurate colours in Fig. 3. If they look different from my descriptions below, then ignore the colours in Fig. 3. At least you can see the relative brightness of these papers and something of their texture in the little insets.</p>

<h3><a name="Vocab">Toward a descriptive vocabulary</a></h3>

<p>Ironically, if i can't rely on photography to accurately convey visual information, I'm going to have to fall back on words. We need words to describe the colour, texture, and sheen of different papers.</p>

<p class=MessageBox><b>A word on white</b>. All the photographic papers I've ever seen can be loosely described as being either white or off-white. The word "white", at least, would seem to be something we can all agree on. Unfortunately, that's no longer so. Over the past few years I've noticed a new faux-cognoscenti fad regarding the word white. It now appears to be "in" to maintain that cream is the "real" white and pure snow white is a crass blue-white. The rest of us know what our eyes tell us. If a painter wants pure, neutral white he uses titanium oxide pigment. If he wants a warmer off-white he can add a smidgeon of brown pigment to that. Yes: it's true that OBAs are bluing agents. That blueness is needed to neutralize the cream colour that is the closest to neutral that natural fibres can get. It's also true that a neutral white paper will look slightly bluish in 5000 Kelvin or warmer light. Daylight gets a lot cooler than the 5000 K of morning and evening. In short: for the purposes of this article when I say white I mean snow white, not off-white.
</p>

<p><b>Colour</b>. A paper that is less than glaringly bright white, yet is still neutral, is a very light grey. A paper that is less than glaringly bright white but is warmer than neutral I'm going to call pale cream. A paper that is darker than pale cream I'm going to call medium cream.</p>

<p>The lab colour numbers are courtesy Ernst Dinkla's <a href="http://www.pigment-print.com/spectralplots/spectrumviz_1.htm">fine reportage</a>. If you know Photoshop you can plug them in to the colour picker to create a swatch.</p>

<p><b>Texture</b>. Fibre papers are called that because they're made of a mat of fine fibres or plant-material hairs glued together to form a thin flat sheet. Nevertheless, from what I've read a sheet of fibre paper has no texture unless a textured surface is pressed against it while drying. Photographers who pay big bucks to work with high megapixel cameras then print at high resolutions likely dream of sneaking into paper mills to replace these textured plates with smooth plates. To their eyes paper texture is the enemy of ultra-fine detail. To a painter the organic texture of watercolour paper or canvas enhances the organic (non-regular) pattern of their brush strokes to create value.
</p>

<p>I see five factors that go into producing a given paper texture: indentation depth, indentation separation, indentation length, pattern type, and pattern regularity. A typical luster RC paper has a texture composed of closely spaced bumps forming a highly regular pattern at a noticeable depth. Leather has a texture composed of broadly spaced curving lines of fairly deep indentation with no regularity/repetition of pattern. </p>

<p><b>Sheen</b>. This is a gamut from total liquid-like gloss to total non-reflective matte. All the papers described here are technically "gloss" papers in the sense that they have a clear varnish-like coating over a powder ink-receptive coating over the substrate. Matte papers have no clear coat. The clear coat can be polished to the glass-like shininess we normally think of the word gloss as applying to, or buffed to an nearly matte finish that paper manufacturers call satin. A noticeable texture also serves to reduce the shininess of gloss, as in the pattern of fine bumps impressed into the surface of a luster RC paper. I will try to keep texture and sheen separate by referring to sheen as being high gloss, medium gloss, low gloss, or matte.

<h3><a name="IWTB">Inkpress Warm Tone Baryta</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Manufacturer</b>: Sihl (centuries-old Swiss mill); North American retailer: <a href="http://www.inkpresspaper.com/">Inkpress</li>
<li><b>Price point</b>: medium</li>
<li><b>Appropriate ink types</b>: dye and photo black pigment</li>
<li><b>Sheet sizes (North American market)</b>: 8x10,8:5x11,11x14,11x17,13x19,16x20,17x22</li>
<li><b>Roll sizes</b>: 17"x50ft, 24"x50', 44"x50ft</li>
<li><b>Substrate material</b>: looks to be cellulose</li>
<li><b>Weight</b>: 290 GSM</li>
<li><b>Thickness</b>: 15 mil, 0:381 mm</li>
<li><b>Stiffness</b>: very stiff (vacuum suction needed for large sheets)</li>
<li><b>Opacity</b>: unknown</li>
<li><b>Coating</b>: Baryta with clear coat</li>
<li><b>Brightness</b>: 85%</li>
<li><b>Colour</b>: Lab: 98.2, -0.2, 3.0. Medium cream</li>
<li><b>Sheen</b>: very slight gloss, maybe 15%?</li>
<li><b>Texture</b>: fairly loose, medium depth, non-regular</li>
<li><b>Dmax</b>: very good but not quite best of class (2.1 at a guess)</li>
<li><b>Gamut</b>: very good</li>
<li><b>pH/Acidity</b>: unknown, but presumably neutral and buffered</li>
<li><b>Longevity</b>: unknown, but no reason it shouldn't be excellent</li>
<li><b>Reference</b>: <a href="http://www.inkpresspaper.com/profiles.asp?PaperID=42">spec sheet</a></li>
<li><b>Notes</b>: Looks to be same paper as Sihl 4804 Professional Photo Barite</li>
<li><b>Indicators</b>: Class, pleasant paper with luxurious heft/thickness. Price is right.</li>
<li><b>Contra-indicators</b>: More texture than most photographers like. Unusual that coating side curls convexly, not concavely. Combination of stiffness and swelling causes head strikes for non-vacuum-feed printers such as Epson 3800 or 3880 at sizes from 13x19 up. Because I like a bit of texture, this would be my go-to paper if only I didn't own a 3800.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="OBA">Appendix A: Thoughts about OBAs (fluorescing optical brighteners).</a></h2>

<p>You can read a beautiful and very detailed <a href="http://www.pigment-print.com/spectralplots/spectrumviz_1.htm">analysis</a> of OBA content in a large selection of inkjet papers by Ernst Dinkla. This comes about due to a debacle in the middle of the last century in which Kodak marketed some of the earliest RC papers, which were used by default world-wide, but in just a few years pictures printed on these papers started to degrade. Fluorescing optical brightening agents were identified as the main culprit and have been the bete noir (bete blanc?) of the print industry ever since.</p>

<p>However, much has changed since then, and paper mills have long since marketed pure white photo papers that have far better permanence capabilities. Whether better OBA chemicals have been identified or smaller amounts are now being used, I don't know. What I do know is that I see little correlation between OBA content and longevity in any of the above papers as measured by <a href="http://www.wilhelm-research.com/">Wilhelm Imaging Research</a>. Given a responsible manufacturer that uses acid-free materials, I'm seeing longevity as much more a consequence of the ink set used than of the paper used. Specifically, HP and Canon inks are testing much higher in longevity on papers with OBA content, than Epson inks on OBA-free papers.</p>

<p>But another issue related to OBAs is metamerism (hues that change depending on which type of light source the print is viewed in). In theory, the violets and blues of a typical RC print (lots of OBAs) would shift when viewed under tungsten vs halogen vs fluorescent vs daylight. I'm seeing no sign of that even with RC prints. And the smallish amount of OBAs present in the papers discussed here that have any should present little such problem.</p>

<p>If you are printing for your own enjoyment, my own take is that you can choose papers with whatever whiteness/brightness you like best. Unfortunately, if you are printing for sale and your customers include connoisseurs and gallery/museum types, you may very well meet up with the persistent prejudice that pure white papers are crass and inferior to the buff/cream colour of traditional, unbrightened stock. Papers like Hahnem&uuml;hle Fine Art Pearl and Ilford Gold Fibre Silk are probably about as white a colour as will pass muster with those who are steeped in the traditional arts.</p>

<h2><a name="Glossary">Appendix B: Inkjet paper characteristics</a></h2>

<p><b>Substrate material</b>. RC papers are made from paper pulp. Art papers are made from either 100% cellulose (lignin-free wood pulp) or cotton rag fibre.</p>

<p><b>Size</b>. Photo paper is commonly available in rolls of a certain width, like 17 or 24 inches, or in cut rectangular sheets of certain standard sizes. In the metric world those sizes are typcially A4, A3, and A2. In North America
sizes are the far less practical letter, 11x17, 13x19, and 17x22 inches.</p>

<p><b>Weight</b>. This is specified in grams per square meter (GSM). This tells you the heft of a sheet of paper, but not much else. Numbers like 188 and 305 GSM are common.</p>

<p><b>Thickness</b>. Measured in mils or millimetres. To convert: multiply mils by 0.0254. RC papers are usually 10.4 mils / 0.264 mm thick. Art papers are usually 3 or 4 mm thick.</p>

<p><b>Stiffness</b>. If there is a measure for this I haven't seen it. In general cellulose papers are stiffer per a given thickness than rag papers. Stiffness is great to prevent creasing or sagging in a frame, but during printing it can be a show-stopper, which is why RC papers are very thin no matter how large the sheet size happens to be.</p>

<p><b>Opacity</b>. Expressed as a percentage of total opacity, like 99%. It's always surprising to hold a thick sheet of paper up to a light and see that some light shines through. I only find opacity to be of importance when prints are bound in a book.</p>

<p><b>Coating</b>. While we know that barium sulfide and calcium carbonate (as a white powder) are ingredients in many coatings, that's about all we know, since the formulae are competitively guarded secrets. In general, inkjet papers are coated with a chalky powder, containing at least calcium carbonate on the ink-receptive side to keep the ink from soaking into the substrate and thus reducing colour vividness. Non-matte papers have an additional clear coat over the powder. This serves to keep the powder and ink from rubbing off but also increases colour vividness in the same way that wetting a piece of wood makes the grain and colours stand out.  The word micro-porous has been used to describe coatings by a variety of manufacturers for several years now.</p>

<p><b>Appropriate ink types</b>. The nature of the coating, not the substrate, determines whether a paper is appropriate for dye inks and/or pigment inks, as well as ink sets containing a matte black vs. a photo black. Essentially, a paper with a clear coat is intended for photo black ink, while paper without a clear coat (matte finish) is intended for matte black ink. This is a distinction that only applies to pigment inks, not dyes.</p>

<p><b>Whiteness/colour</b>. Expressed as a percentage of pure whiteness, like 99%. Pure cellulose or pure cotton rag has a buff/cream colour. Using a white powder coating helps to whiten a paper to a certain degree, but beyond that whitening chemicals called optical brightening agents (OBAs) must be added to the substrate when more brightness is desired.</p>

<p><b>Sheen</b>. Measured as a percent of totally reflective gloss. Verbally expressed, an uncoated paper or a powder-only coated paper is matte (non-reflective) in finish. Clear coats can have a variety of sheens from near-matte to full gloss.</p>

<p><b>Texture</b>. No common measure that I know of. Verbally, I'm reporting indentation separation/fineness, indentation depth, and pattern regularity..</p>

<p><b>Dmax</b>. This is a technical term to indicate how black the darkest black achievable on a particular paper is. Problem is that it depends as much on the ink used as the paper itself, although of late pigment photo blacks seem to have caught up with each other and are now at least fairly close to dye black. Again, a glossy clear coat helps in achieving maximum blackness. For reference, a Dmax over 2 is considered a very good number.</p>

<p><b>DR (dynamic range)</b>: is the difference in the brightness range of colours that can be achieved between the paper's whiteness and its Dmax blackness. (If you know the brightness and Dmax of a paper you know the DR, so there's probably little point providing all three numbers.)</p>

<p><b>Gamut</b>. This is the measure of how vivid/saturated each colour of the spectrum can be on a given paper. Again this is entirely dependent on the ink set used as well as the paper, but if a given paper has gamut limitations for one ink set it likely has them for all ink sets. Gamut numbers are quite complex. While gamut was a serious issue a few years back and remains a differentiator for matte papers, for clear coated papers the differences then to be small.</p>

<p><b>pH/Acidity</b>. The pH of a paper needs to be absolutely non-acidic or the paper will simply eat itself over time. pH of 7 is neutral; less than 7 acidic, greater than 7 alkaline. Many or most of these papers also have a buffering compound in the coating to neutralize environmental acidity.</p>

<p><b>Longevity</b>. Measured in years. This is another factor that varies with the ink set used as well as the paper itself. Paper can yellow with time, it can react to environmental pollutants like natural gas and ozone, it can react with the inks applied to it causing them to fade or discolour. But equally, dye inks have the advantage of really dark blacks but change colour over a much shorter time (up to a couple decades) than do pigment inks (up to a couple centuries). Measuring longevity is a black art about which you can read here; <a href="http://www.wilhelm-research.com/">Wilhelm Imaging Research</a>.</p>
