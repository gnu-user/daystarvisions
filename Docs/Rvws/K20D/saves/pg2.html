<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 7: Actual pixels (100% mag.) crop

<p>Since the days of the first commercial colour film, photographers have grown into the idea that you choose a film to give you a certain &quot;look&quot;, meaning colour rendition. Digital camera brands and models really don't have a particular colour rendering signature; instead, you customize colour rendering both in the camera and in post-processing to taste. If you rely solely on in-camera colour settings (as in shooting JPEG), then yes, you'll see differences from camera to camera. But if you shoot RAW, colour handling starts with an accurate camera profile, the job of which is to ensure that colours captured match what the human eye would have seen when the frame was exposed.

<p>In the case of RAW shooting there can be camera-specific colour idiosyncracies, such as an inability for the camera to capture a specific hue, but the most meaningful variation is bit-depth, meaning the ability to distinguish between extremely fine differences in hue. Think of an egg. Not only do we want the exact shade of cream or brown, but we want the change in colour as more brightly lit areas blend into shadow areas. The K20D has a theoretical bit-depth of 14 bits, which means it has the potential to capture even finer gradations between light cream and shadowed cream, for example, then the 12-bits that were typical of previous camera models. A big problem here is to actually see this improvement, since we are limited by the capabilities of our monitors and our printers in rendering these subtleties. 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/DC8-20-K20D0806_sz950x713.jpg"><IMG src="images/DC8-20-K20D0806_sz600x450.jpg" width=600 height=450 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 8: DC8-20 (1600 ISO)

<p>The snow areas in Fig. 7 and the wall and skin areas in Fig. 8 should highlight the gradations capability of the camera; but between the limitations of the 8-bit JPEG file format and the essentially 8-bit capabilities of your monitor, you won't be seeing anything special. [<b>Update</b>: after doing several prints I'm convinced. The improvement on paper (as opposed to on screen) is palpable. I'm seeing film-like colour without the film-like grain in my low-ISO shots. Whether this is due to the 14-bit upgrade or simply to the finer sampling per sq. in. from the extra pixels or some other factor, I can't say. )

<h4><a name="dr_and_noise">IQ 3: Latitude/DR and noise</a></h4>

<p>Much has been made on-line about the supposed improvements of the K20D in these areas. For latitude, the camera has a dynamic range boost function called D-Range available in the Fn button menu. There is also a JPEG-specific HDR processing option. For noise, the idea is that the increased pixel count of the K20D (14.6 mp) over the K10D (10 mp) comes without the expected penalty of increased noise at a given ISO.

<p>Looking into D-Range first, the best I can find is about a 0.4 stop extension of highlight latitude, but with an equivalent loss in shadow latitude in some shots. Another datum is that D-Range cannot be applied to the 100 ISO, which is the camera's slowest ISO setting. I like <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1036&message=26981987">Joseph Tainter's</a> theory that nothing more is going on here than underexposure combined with a development curve that bulges a bit in the middle zones. (Any suggestions for testing D-Range are welcome.)

<p>To illustrate the HDR (high dynamic range) option I went into the in-camera development menu and converted the DNG file for Fig. 4 into an HDR JPEG. This site is rated G, so I can't show you the result unless you sign a disclaimer saying you accept responsibility for any damage your eyesight may incur from viewing this level of violence, then click <a href="images/K20D-Test-0833_sz600x399_HDR.jpg">here</a>.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 9: K20D's in-camera HDR-->

I'm sure there is someone somewhere who will appreciate this innovation... (Incidentally: the super-saturation and cyan hue shift are courtesy of the K20D's JPEG processing engine. Enjoy.)

<p>The following seemingly innocuous shot is the method I've been using for years now to extract latitude and noise confessions from reluctant cameras. If you are a gentleman photographer who always works in low to medium contrast light, these results may not interest you; but I, like many others, find that some of the best images have to be wrestled free of their high contrast setting:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 10: Dale's torture test (100 ISO) (full size 3.2 mp JPEG <a href="images/K20D-Test-843-full_no_edit.jpg">here</a>)

<p>This was shot in raw at 100 ISO with manual exposure set to just blow the highlights in the brightest part of the frame &ndash; in this case the left window edge. To the human eye the room interior was reasonably well lit, while the left window edge was glaring. To the camera, as we see, everything but that window edge is shrouded in darkness.

<p>Here is the same shot but this time with an extreme curve applied in Photoshop to open things up (although the shadow areas are still nothing like as bright as my eye sees them when I look at this scene):

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop2_sz600x700.jpg" width=600 height=700 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 11: Brighter view

<p>The red numbers are EVs (exposure values) metered with my trusty old Seiko Digi-Spot handheld lightmeter. The big 16 is where the highlights blow and all the other EVs are darker. If we subtract the red 5.0 in the maw of my silver and black Epson inkjet from 16 we get 11, which tells us that that part of the scene is 11 stops dimmer than the left window edge. As we would expect, we can see in Fig. 11 there is no detail, only noise at 11 stops:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 12: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 11 stops

<p>More troubling is that noise is noticeably present even at a mere 6.5 stops (but understand that this presentation mercilessly reveals latent noise):

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop4_sz470x450.jpg" width=470 height=450 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 13: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 6.5 stops

<p>This little noise would not be noticeable without the brightening curve and cleans up easily with a bit of noise reduction, but it portends that high ISO shooting could be a bed of roses (beware of thorns). Here's a crop at 8.5 stops:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop5_sz450x500.jpg" width=450 height=500 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 14: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 8.5 stops

<p>The noise level here constitutes roughly half of all pixels and strongly degrades detail. Still: depending on your usage, you may not need detail in the extreme shadow areas. I'm willing to call the K20D's low ISO latitude at somewhere between 7.5 and 8.5 stops if you are. ;) And, of course, this will degrade at higher ISOs.
