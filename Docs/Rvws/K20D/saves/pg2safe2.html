<H1>The Pentax K20D: a RAW review</H1>
<P CLASS=SmallNoteCentered>Version 1.2, &copy; 2007 by Dale Cotton, all rights reserved

<h4>IQ 3: Latitude/DR and noise</h4>

<p>Much has been made on-line about the supposed improvements of the K20D in these areas. For latitude, the camera has a dynamic range boost function called D-Range available in the Fn button menu. There is also a JPEG-specific HDR processing option. For noise, the idea is that the increased pixel count of the K20D (14.6 mp) over the K10D (10 mp) comes without the expected penalty of increased noise at a given ISO.

<p>Looking into D-Range first, the best I can find is about a 0.4 stop extension of highlight latitude, but with an equivalent loss in shadow latitude in some shots. Another datum is that D-Range cannot be applied to the 100 ISO, which is the camera's slowest ISO setting. I like <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1036&message=26981987">Joseph Tainter's</a> theory that nothing more is going on here than underexposure combined with a development curve that bulges a bit in the middle zones.

<p>To illustrate the HDR (high dynamic range) option I went into the in-camera development menu and converted the DNG file for Fig. 4 into an HDR JPEG. This site is rated G, so I can't show you the result unless you sign a disclaimer saying you accept responsibility for any damage your eyesight may incur from viewing this level of violence, then click <a href="images/K20D-Test-0833_sz600x399_HDR.jpg">here</a>.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 9: K20D's in-camera HDR-->

I'm sure there is someone somewhere who will appreciate this innovation... (Incidentally: the super-saturation and cyan hue shift are courtesy of the K20D's JPEG processing engine. Enjoy.)

<p>The following seemingly innocuous shot is the method I've been using for years now to extract latitude and noise confessions from reluctant cameras. If you are a gentleman photographer who always works in low to medium contrast light, these results may not interest you; but I, like many others, find that some of the best images have to be wrestled free of their high contrast setting:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop1_sz600x700.jpg" width=600 height=700 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 10: Dale's torture test (100 ISO) (full size 3.2 mp JPEG<a href="images/K20D-Test-843-full_no_edit.jpg">here</a>)

<p>This was shot in raw at 100 ISO with manual exposure set to just blow the highlights in the brightest part of the frame &ndash; in this case the left window edge. To the human eye the room interior was reasonably well lit, while the left window edge was glaring. To the camera, as we see, everything but that window edge is shrouded in darkness.

<p>Here is the same shot but this time with an extreme curve applied in Photoshop to open things up (although the shadow areas are still nothing like as bright as my eye sees them when I look at this scene):

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop2_sz600x700.jpg" width=600 height=700 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 11: Brighter view

<p>The red numbers are EVs (exposure values) metered with my trusty old Seiko Digi-Spot handheld lightmeter. The big 16 is where the highlights blow and all the other EVs are darker. If we subtract the red 5.0 in the maw of my silver and black Epson inkjet from 16 we get 11, which tells us that that part of the scene is 11 stops dimmer than the left window edge. As we would expect, we can see in Fig. 11 there is no detail, only noise at 11 stops:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop3_sz474x450.jpg" width=470 height=450 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 12: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 11 stops

<p>More troubling is that noise is noticeably present even at a mere 6.5 stops (but understand that this presentation mercilessly reveals latent noise):

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop4_sz470x450.jpg" width=470 height=450 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 13: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 6.5 stops

<p>This little noise would not be noticeable without the brightening curve and cleans up easily with a bit of noise reduction, but it portends that high ISO shooting could be a bed of roses (beware of thorns). Here's a crop at 8.5 stops:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0843-crop5_sz450x500.jpg" width=450 height=500 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 14: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 8.5 stops

<p>The noise level here constitutes roughly half of all pixels and strongly degrades detail. Still: depending on your usage, you may not need detail in the extreme shadow areas. I'm willing to call the K20D's low ISO latitude at somewhere between 7.5 and 8.5 stops if you are. ;) And, of course, this will degrade at higher ISOs.

<h4>IQ 4: ISO (sensitivity) capabilities</h4>

<p>Now that we've got a handle on latitude, let's look at the K20D's ISO capabilities. Here's a sequence from crops from RAW shots of a Color Checker print shot at all ISO settings (you have to click on the pic to bring up the 1 mb, full size version, if you want to actually see anything.):

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-GM_noise-all_ISOs_sz2050x2450.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-GM_noise-all_ISOs_sz335x400.jpg" width=335 height=400 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 15: ISO test results (click <a href="images/K20D-GM_noise-all_ISOs_sz2050x2450.jpg">here</a> for full size)

<p>What we see is that there is minor shadow noise at 100 ISO; at 200 noise is barely perceptible in the mid-tones and not bad in the shadows; at 400 noise is quite noticeable in the mid-tones and serious in the shadows; and it quickly slides down hill from there. 400 ISO is recoverable using a good noise reducer like Noise Ninja with no perceptible loss of detail; 800 is recoverable with a slight loss of detail; 1600 is recoverable with significant loss of detail; 3200 and 6400 are not fully recoverable &ndash; serious noise artifacts will remain in the shadows no matter how aggressively you sic noise reduction on the file.

<p>Given the noise we see at 3200, let alone 6400, we might think these extreme settings are useless, but look-ee here:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/DC8-22-K20D0906-b_sz950x665.jpg"><IMG src="images/DC8-22-K20D0906-b_sz600x420.jpg" width=600 height=420 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 16: DC8-22, 6400 ISO handheld at 1/60th

<p>The combination of high ISO and image stabilization made for a handheld grab shot that proved quite a meaty bone to toss in the direction of Photoshop. I got technically better frames at the same place/time at lower ISOs, but none nearly so interesting to my eye. The wonderful starring around the street lights only happens at 6400 and you get wonderfully gritty film-like grain in the bargain:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/DC8-22-K20D0906-b_crop_sz600x467.jpg" width=600 height=467 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 17: DC8-22 crop (Close Encounters meets Starry, Starry Night)

<p>Guess we'd better investigate this high ISO night shooting a bit further. 1600 looks remarkably fine-grained and reasonably crisp with just a normal amount of raw converter tuning:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-1600ISO-1032_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-1600ISO-1032_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 18: 1600 ISO handheld at 1/50th (full size 4.6 mp JPEG <a href="images/K20D-1600ISO-1032_full_size_edited.jpg">here</a>) 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-1600ISO-1035_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-1600ISO-1035_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 19: 1600 ISO handheld at 1/6th (full size 3.4 mp JPEG <a href="images/K20D-1600ISO-1035_full_size_edited.jpg">here</a>) 

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-1600ISO-1035_crop_sz540x575.jpg" width=540 height=575 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 20: crop from Fig. 19

<p>3200 is definitely getting gritty:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-3200ISO-1047_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-3200ISO-1047_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 21: 3200 ISO handheld at 1/8th (full size 3.9 mp JPEG <a href="images/K20D-3200ISO-1047_full_size_LR_adj_only.jpg">here</a>) 

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-3200ISO-1047_crop_sz540x620.jpg" width=540 height=620 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 22: crop from Fig. 21

<p>Finally: another 6400 to see whether Fig. 17 was a fluke:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-6400ISO-1043_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-6400ISO-1043_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 23: 6400 ISO handheld at 1/15th (full size 4.7 mp JPEG <a href="images/K20D-6400ISO-1043_full_size_LR_adj_only.jpg">here</a>) 

<p>It wasn't. 

<p>But all is not wine and roses in high ISO land and there are other reasons to shoot at higher ISOs than available darkness. Consider this grab shot taken in Toronto's Union Station on my daily commute:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Union_Station-1-60_sec_f8_sz500x750.jpg" width=500 height=750 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 24: 1600 ISO handheld at 1/60th

<p>Because of the mostly dim internal lighting a high ISO is needed to work handheld; but because of the high contrast light from the windows, the DR of the scene is broad. Here's a small portion of Fig. 23 with zero noise reduction on the left and with as much noise reduction as I could tolerate applied in Noise Ninja on the right:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Union_Station-1-60_sec_f8_crop_sz600x500.jpg" width=600 height=500 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 24: crop from Fig. 23

<p>The moral seems to be: when you're forced to use high ISOs in high contrast light, forget about preserving highlights &ndash; just strive to save the shadows.

<p>And that's it for the first installment. Stay tuned for further developments.
