<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 1: Pentax K20D

<p>A month ago I wrote a backgrounder called <a href="//daystarvisions.com/Docs/Tuts/LandCam/pg1.html">Shopping for a Landscape Camera</a>, explaining why I was excited enough by the specs of the Pentax K20D to pre-order it. Now that the camera is in my hands, my next task is to evaluate it. One reason I shop locally whenever possible &ndash; in this case at <a href="http://www.henrys.ca">Henry's</a> &ndash; is the ability to return for a full refund within 14 days. I need to find out whether I'm going to keep this camera (whether it lives up to its promise) in that short time. The results I come up with may be of interest to those specifically considering a K20D. As well, the methodology I use may be of use to those of you who are fairly new to photography who may find themselves shopping for a camera now or in days to come.

<p>I'm going to divide this task into two broad areas: usability and image quality (IQ).

<h2>Week One</h2>

<p>The camera arrived on an early March Friday ... but so did a huge blizzard here in southern Ontario. This was somewhat frustrating given it's hard to take a sweeping landscape shot to evaluate a camera's fine detail rendition when falling snow is filling the air. So I contented myself with this shot through my bedroom window and moved on:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="K20D-Test-0743_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0743_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 2: Storm a-brewing (800 ISO, handheld + IS)

<h3 class="Left">Handling &ndash; first impressions</h3>

<p>The first task when getting a new digital camera is to plug the battery in the charger then plow through the manual. In this case over 150 action-packed pages of almost-reasonable English. (Actually, the main language problem is not that the manual was written by a non-native speaker; but that it was written in non-technical language. Kind of hard to talk about dynamic range or exposure latitude when you can't actually <i>use</i> either of those terms.) The manual is so long because the camera has so many features. What a camera is today is actually a full-scale software application, like Photoshop or MS Word, running on a dedicated computer with some specialized and integrated peripheral devices like a sensor and a lens. Thus, using a modern camera has become as much a software learning-curve challenge as a hardware challenge. Now, you might think that you could just set the camera in manual exposure plus manual focus and away you go &ndash; but, no: you have to learn how to change the ISO, change the default 1 sec. display time for the image you just exposed on the monitor to something actually usable, etc., etc.

<p>Also, since I owned and loved a previous-model Pentax dSLR, you'd think I would already know how to do something as simple as AF lock, but no: they couldn't leave well enough alone. The things you didn't want changed have been changed; and the things you wanted changed are left the same.

<h3>Things that should have been changed but weren't</h3>

<ul>
<li>ISO. Three things effect exposure in equal measure: aperture, shutter, and ISO. All three need to be visible in the finder and all three need to be easily modified. Why is this such a difficult concept for camera designers to grasp? My 35 year old Nikon F2 has a dedicated ISO knob. Why can't a K20D? In fact, it can and does so ... but only in TAv mode (a Pentax special, locking both shutter and aperture while varying ISO according to the meter reading).

<li>This one deserves a new acronym, so unless someone can come up with a better term, I'll call it Highlight Protection Metering or HPM (related to but not quite the same as expose-to-the-right). Because the latitude of digital cameras is finite, every photographer past kindergarten has one over-riding concern: to let as much light as possible hit the sensor just short of blowing non-specular highlights. This is why we have blinking blown-highlight display and in-camera histograms. Why not just provide a dedicated HPM mode and be done with it?
</ul>

<p>As my father would say: Sheesh!

<h3 class="Left">Image Quality &ndash; first impressions</h3>

<h4>IQ 1: Resolution and acutance</h4>

<p>After leaving behind over a foot of snow, the storm cleared Saturday night, leaving me with perfect blue sky no wind weather on Sunday:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="K20D-Test-0833_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0833_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 3: Shovelling ahead (100 ISO, tripod)

<p>First things first, Fig. 3 was intended for the single purpose of finding out how large a print the K20D is good for under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions meaning tripod, low ISO, sweet spot of the lens (28mm @ f/8), mirror lock-up, RAW capture, bright light, and no wind. Having spent years doing wooded landscapes, the bare branches of distant trees is the most demanding subject matter I'm familiar with for sheer resolution and what I prefer to use for detail evaluation. The ash tree just right of the big fir is what I focused on and is about 60 feet away from the camera.

<p>One downside of being the first kid on the block with a new camera is that the raw converters haven't yet caught up. Pentax Laboratory is the kiddie toy that ships with the camera. But a beta release of SilkyPix supports the K20D both PEF and DNG, and my main squeeze, Lightroom, knows DNG, but doesn't have any profiles for this particular camera. I downloaded a trial version of SilkyPix, found the interface just as obscure as ever, but managed to establish that Lightroom wasn't having any problems interpreting K20 DNGs, at least in the resolution department. So I cranked out a PSD file, sent it to Photoshop, and applied the least invasive USM I could come up with to crispen up the acutance: Amount/Radius/Threshold 500/0.2/0 then 375/0.2/0 then a titch at 0.3. As you can see from Fig. 4, this very minimal dose of USM was enough to clean up the edges nicely:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0833-crop1_sz600x600.jpg" width=600 height=600 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 4: Actual pixels (100% mag.) crop (minimal USM)

<p>So I set the ppi to an even 200 to give a print size of 15.5" x 23.3", took an 11" x 17" crop from that, put a sheet of 13" x 19" RC paper in my printer (Epson 3800), and hit Print. Ten minutes later I was holding a piece of paper that fairly boggled my mind. A friend of mine and sometime guest artist on this site does a combination of 6x7 medium format and 4x5 large format with fine-grained slide film scanned at 2500 ppi then printed to sizes like 18" x 22". That's the kind of detail and sheer image quality I'm seeing when I look at this test print. I then printed the entire frame at 288 ppi for a 10.8" x 16.2" image, fully expecting from past experience to be even more impressed with the finer scale detail ... but I wasn't. The second print was just smaller; there was no sense of more closely approaching contact print goodness. IOW: the contact print goodness is already there in the 200 ppi print, which isn't supposed to be possible. Now that's a lot to try to take away from two prints from one image file, but it certainly augers well for the future.

<h4>IQ 2: Colour and gradations</h4>

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0833-crop2_sz600x600.jpg" width=600 height=600 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 5: Actual pixels (100% mag.) crop

<p>Since the days of the first commercial colour film, photographers have grown into the idea that you choose a film to give you a certain &quot;look&quot;, meaning colour rendition. Digital camera brands and models really don't have a particular colour rendering signature; instead, you customize colour rendering both in the camera and in post-processing to taste. If you rely slowly on in-camera colour settings (as in shooting JPEG), then yes, you'll see differences from camera to camera. But if you shoot RAW, colour handling starts with an accurate camera profile, the job of which is to ensure that colours captured match what the human eye would have seen when the frame was exposed.

<p>In the case of RAW shooting there can be camera-specific colour idiosyncracies, such as an inability for the camera to capture a specific hue, but the most meaningful variation is bit-depths, meaning the ability to distinguish between extremely fine differences in hue. Think of an egg. Not only do we want the exact shade of cream or brown, but we want the change in colour as more brightly lit areas blend into shadow areas. The K20D has a theoretical bit-depth of 14 bits, which means it has the potential to capture even finer gradations between light cream and shadowed cream, for example, then the 12-bits that were typical of previous camera models. A big problem here is to actually see this improvement, since we are limited by the capabilities of our monitors and our printers in rendering these subtleties. 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="DC8-20-K20D0806_sz950x713.jpg"><IMG SRC="DC8-20-K20D0806_sz600x450.jpg" width=600 height=450 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: DC8-20 (1600 ISO)

<p>Fig. 5 in the snow areas and Fig. 6 in the wall and skin areas should highlight the gradations capability of the camera; but between the limitations of the 8-bit JPEG file format and the essentially 8-bit capabilities of your monitor, you won't be seeing anything special.

<h4>IQ 3: Latitude/DR and noise</h4>

<p>Much has been made on-line about the supposed improvements of the K20D in these areas. For latitude, the camera has a dynamic range boost function called D-Range available in the Fn button menu. There is also a JPEG-specific HDR processing option. For noise, the idea is that the increased pixel count of the K20D (14.6 mp) over the K10D (10 mp) comes without the expected penalty of increased noise at a given ISO. 

<p>Looking into D-Range first, the best I can find is about a 0.4 stop extension of highlight latitude, but with an equivalent loss in shadow latitude in some shots. Another datum is that D-Range cannot be applied to the 100 ISO, which is the camera's slowest ISO setting. These facts suggests that nothing more is going on here than underexposure combined with a development curve that bulges a bit in the middle zones.

<p>To illustrate the HDR (high dynamic range) option I went into the in-camera development menu and converted the DNG file for Fig. 3 into an HDR JPEG. This site is rated G, so I can't show you the result unless you sign a disclaimer saying you accept responsibility for any damage your eyesight may incur from viewing this level of violence, then click <a href="K20D-Test-0833_sz600x399_HDR.jpg">here</a>.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: K20D's in-camera HDR-->

I'm sure there is someone somewhere who will appreciate this innovation... (Incidentally: the super-saturation and cyan hue shift are courtesy of the K20D's JPEG processing engine. Enjoy.)

<p>This seemingly innocuous shot is the method I've been using for years now to extract latitude and noise confessions from reluctant cameras:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0843-crop1_sz600x700.jpg" width=600 height=700 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 7: Dale's torture test (100 ISO)

<p>This was shot in raw at 100 ISO with manual exposure set to just blow the highlights in the brightest part of the frame &ndash; in this case the left window edge. To the human eye the room interior was reasonably well lit, while the left window edge was glaring. To the camera, as we see, everything but that window edge is shrouded in darkness.

<p>Here is the same shot but this time with a curve applied to open things up:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0843-crop2_sz600x700.jpg" width=600 height=700 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 8: Brighter view

<p>The red numbers are EVs (exposure values) metered with my trusty old Seiko Digi-Spot handheld lightmeter. The big 16 is where the highlights blow and all the other EVs are darker. If we subtract the red 5.0 in the maw of my silver and black Epson inkjet from 16 we get 11, which tells us that that part of the scene is 11 stops dimmer than the left window edge. As we would expect, we can see in Fig. 9 there is no detail, only noise at 11 stops:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0843-crop3_sz600x600.jpg" width=600 height=700 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 9: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 11 stops

<p>More troubling is that noise is noticeably present even at a mere 6.5 stops:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="K20D-Test-0843-crop4_sz600x600.jpg" width=600 height=700 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 10: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 6.5 stops

<p>This little noise cleans up easily with a bit of noise reduction, but it portends that high ISO shooting isn't going to be a bed of roses. 

<p>The window shot tells us that we can ignore DR beyond 8 stops, so for the ISO testing, I'll use a somewhat less extreme scene:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="K20D-100_ISO_test-0947_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 11: ISO test scenario

<p>I shot the above frame in RAW on a tripod at ISOs from 100 to 6400 then developed each frame in Lightroom with the same minimalist settings, including a linear curve and zero noise reduction. I've shown EV measurements in red again, but this time in white I've shown the number of stops departure from the blowout point (EV 10 on the lamp) for each EV reading. The white rectangle is the area we'll examine at full size, since it covers a good range of EVs for noise handling. Click on Fig. 12 for a large (1.5 mb) high-quality JPEG showing this crop from 100 to 6400 ISO: 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="ISO_noise_levels_sz833x1555.jpg"><IMG SRC="ISO_noise_levels_sz416x777.jpg" width=416 height=777 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 12: ISO test results (click pic for full size)

<p>What we see is that there is minor shadow noise at 100 ISO; at 200 noise is barely perceptible in the mid-tones and not bad in the shadows; at 400 noise is quite noticeable in the mid-tones and serious in the shadows; and it quickly slides down hill from there. 400 ISO is recoverable using a good noise reducer like Noise Ninja with no perceptible loss of detail; 800 is recoverable with a slight loss of detail; 1600 is recoverable with significant loss of detail; 3200 and 6400 are not fully recoverable &ndash; serious noise artifacts will remain no matter how aggressively you sic noise reduction on the file.

<p>Given the noise we see at 3200, let alone 6400, we might think these extreme settings are useless, but see here:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="DC8-22-K20D0906-b_sz950x665.jpg"><IMG SRC="DC8-22-K20D0906-b_sz600x420.jpg" width=600 height=420 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 13: DC8-22, 6400 ISO

<p>The combination of high ISO and image stabilization made for a handheld grab shot that proved quite a meaty bone to toss in the direction of Photoshop. I got technically better frames at the same place/time at lower ISOs, but none nearly so interesting to my eye. The wonderful starring around the street lights only happens at 6400 and you get wonderfully gritty film-like grain in the bargain:
