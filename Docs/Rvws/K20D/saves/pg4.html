<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 29: 1600 ISO handheld

<p>The most likely reason you're reading this review is that you are considering purchasing the K20D and you want to figure out whether you should or no. So let's recap some fairly objective factoids:

<ul>
<li><b>Handling and features</b>: standard modern 2 lb dSLR design with in-camera image stabilization, an excellent pentaprism finder, 2% spot metering, at least decent AF, 3 frames/sec, highly responsive, highly customizable.
<li><b>Low ISO output</b>: stunning 14.6 megapixel RAW images. Superb detail and colour plus reasonable, if not wonderful, DR, and low noise at ISOs up to 400. 800 ISO shows only the slightest degradation.
<li><b>High ISO output</b>: a bit on the noisy side; similar to last year's 10 megapixel dSLRs from 1600 to 6400 ISO.
</ul>

<p>The 14.6 mp number jumps out as the current lead in the semi-pro class. You can confirm for yourself that this is not just an empty number by looking at the full-size JPEGs available in this review. Many have theorized that the K10D's class-leading 10 mp RAW resolution might be attributed to a weak anti-aliasing filter; if so, this continues to be true for the K20D. 

<p>Not everyone needs that many megapixels, however superb. The K20D's at best average high ISO capabilities, combined with in-camera IS, are also a potent combination for handheld, low-light shooting. On the downside, the combination of unexceptional AF and lowish FPS make for a camera that fast-action shooters will want to take a pass on.

<h3><a name="tech_conf">Technical confirmation</a></h3>

<p>As I've stated repeatedly this is a pragmatic review. I may know something about how to take a photograph, but am not any kind of expert in engineering matters. It was therefore a great relief to me to have some confirmation that I haven't strayed too far from the course in the results I've reported so far. I hope to present this material more formally at some point, but for now see <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1036&message=27189845">this post</a> by Gordon Goodsman to the Pentax SLR forum of dpreview.com for some very acute analysis of the K20D's capabilities. 

<h3><a name="vis_conf">Visual confirmation</a></h3>

<p>I shot the following pic with the K20D handheld in downtown Toronto:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-Toronto-20080314-100ISO-f4-640sec-1058_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-Toronto-20080314-100ISO-f4-640sec-1058_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 27: 100 ISO handheld at 1/640th (full size, level 12, 8.6 mp JPEG <a href="images/K20D-Toronto-20080314-100ISO-f4-640sec-1058.jpg">here</a>) 

<p>It's probably foolish of me to post a full-res print-ready version of a portfolio-grade shot, but there ya' go! ;) Download the full size pic and print it at any size up to 16x24"/A2 using your best-quality printer settings; the resulting print will answer a lot of questions. The reason I suggest printing this particular shot is that it covers so much IQ ground: detail handling, colour gradations, dynamic range, and shadow noise.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 29: 1600 ISO handheld

<p>The most likely reason you're reading this review is that you are considering purchasing the K20D. After all the verbal and visual content I've thrown at you thus far, together with the barrage of your own thoughts arising from that and other content, it would be easy to lose sight of a simple concept. As they say in jolly old England: horses for courses. The first thing that stands out about the K20D is that it has a 14.6 megapixel imager. We all went through years of severe megapixel rationing and are all still a bit over-sensitive to the issue of not having enough pixels/resolution for a given print size, so 14.6 has the same sort of instant appeal as the words &quot;long tall cold one&quot; do after a sweaty work out on a hot day. Hold that thought for a sec.

<p>The second thing that jumps out about the K20D is that those 14.6 megapixels are crammed into an APS-C sensor, not a FF sensor (let alone an MF sensor). If you evenly divide a fixed sensor area into more pixels, then of course each pixel has to be smaller, and each pixel has to have less light gathering surface area. Therefore the expectation would be that an increase in pixel count would come at the cost of a <i>decrease</i> in signal-to-noise ratio; to put it simply: more but lower-quality pixels per image per ISO level. 

<p>So now the third thing that jumps out about the K20D is Pentax' claim that due to sensor design improvements the increase in pixel count has <b>not</b> resulted in a higher signal-to-noise ratio. My empirical testing over the past three pages matches the no-holds-barred technical analysis of some brighter bulbs than mine that this is indeed at least approximately the case. These are 14.6 million very useful pixels per image file we have here ... and that's finally enough with which to make 16x24/A2 prints of even the most challengingly high-detailed subject matter. Prints that have to apologize for <i>nothing</i> in the way of image quality, and smaller prints than that are just that much better.

<p>But wait! There's more! Not only can the K20D give us superb large prints, it can also do so <i>handheld</i>! Thanks to Pentax' early-on we-try-harder thinking they now have a mature and incredibly useful image stabilization system built into the camera body. And in spite of the larger file size the camera responds instantly to your least command and loses nothing in frames-per-sec over last year's model. Plus, the finder is excellent and it's packed with nifty usability bonuses like in-camera RAW-to-JPEG conversion. 

<p>Now back to megapixel rationing and horses for courses. The problem here is that you may not be in a branch of photography for which sumptuous 16x24/A2 printing is of any great relevance. Not a lot of baby's-first-birthday nor we-saw-the-Eiffel-Tower nor Rugby-action nor motorsports-hair-raiser nor dental-reconstruction shots are going to be printed at those sizes or examined for that level of aesthetic goodness at any size. 

<p>18 months ago Pentax and Samsung made a tactical decision that by the time 2008 rolled around the camera they wanted to bring to market would need to have at least 14 megapixels to compete in the semi-pro arena. Here we are in 2008 and behold: the semi-pro competition opted to go with 12 megapixels for APS-C, and improve in other areas, such as high ISO, DR, and frame rate. Again: Pentax managed it's 14.6 APS-C megapixel minor miracle without going backward in those other areas ... but it didn't go forward in those areas either. If you can benefit from the extra resolution and don't need more/better ISO, DR, frame rate, etc. than last year's model (and few of us do), then you're laughing.

<p>So far as I can tell, the semi-pro/APS-C dSLR is at a fork in the road. There needs to be a new specialization such that manufacturers do for the semi-pro photographer what they've long done for the pro. There is a Canon 1DIII for action work and a Canon 1DSIII for detail work, a Nikon D3 for action work and there will surely soon be a Nikon D3X for detail work. In the semi-pro arena the same thinking should prevail. So far as I can see 8 megapixels is plenty for action work. If the manufacturers would just wise up and start applying the same advances to 8 megapixel APS-C scale imagers &ndash; reducing noise, increasing ISO and frame rate to incredible heights &ndash; they'd really have something. 

<p>The Canon 40D and Nikon D300 are semi-pro models that try to be jacks-of-all trades. Good but not superb high ISO, DR, resolution, frame rate, etc. An action shooter rarely wants 12 megapixels and the detail shooter rarely wants 6 frames per sec, so the Canon and Nikon approach represents a compromise all around. They missed out on the opportunity to really please any segment of the market. 

<p>In the K20D Pentax at least has their optimized-for-detail specialist camera. Now they need to apply their collective cleverness to creating a parallel, optimized for action, semi-pro line. Unfortunately, as (a distant) number 3 in sales, we know they just don't have the resources to pursue parallel semi-pro lines. In that wise, the decision to shoot for 14+ megapixels might seem a mistake, since Canon and Nikon did not make the expected push to that height. A mistake in sales terms, at least. For those of us who do landscape, group portraiture, product shots on a budget, etc., it's a delightful windfall. 

<p>For those who really know Pentax, there's no mistake at all. Pentax doesn't <i>want</i> to catch up to Canon or Nikon in volume. They don't <i>want</i> that kind of pressure to perform. They want to make enough money so they can afford to make the camera they themselves would most love to shoot with and they want to have a gas doing it. So sayeth my crystal ball. ;)-->

<h3><a name="sr">Shake reduction (AKA image stabilization)</a></h3>

<!--p>I spent some time standing in front of a window shooting a USAF resolution target handheld at progressively low shutters to try to test IS. My conclusion: to do this even approximately right I'd need to round up a dozen veteran photogs, stand each of them in front of the res target, doing a large number of trials at progressively slower shutters with various length and weight lenses, then do some stats on the results. 

<p>All I can say is that Pentax' IS/SR certainly improves over handheld, but how much it improves and whether the improvement exceeds previous models as claimed, I haven't a clue. What I <i>can</i> add to the conversation is that, in spite of any improvements, you will want to up what you consider to be a safe slow shutter speed a notch or two. I am wont to consider 1/20th with a short lens as a reasonable risk with my IS-capable 8 megapixel camera; but with the K20D I agree with Pentax that 1/50th is the better bet. This is because the 14 mp resolution is in the ballpark of twice that of some typical 35mm film stock and so is twice as merciless at revealing jitter. 

<p>Of course, that's assuming low ISO shooting. At higher ISOs, the resolution is lost to noise in any case, so you can go back to gambling on slower shutters with greater impunity.-->

<p>IS testing probably requires some sort of calibrated vibration machine for consistent results. But just to get an idea of what to expect, I propped a res chart up on a desk top, stood several feet back then took successive frames at progressively slower shutters, once with SR off and once with SR on:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 30: IS testing

<p>Clearly, SR is doing its job; but bear in mind I used the 16-45/4 at 45mm for this test (not having anything longer at present). No one expects to go as slow as 1/15th with significant tele glass, even with IS this good. The 1/60th with SR shot is every bit as sharp as a tripod shot with mirror lock-up. (BTW: although the manual says to turn SR off when shooting from a tripod, I haven't yet seen a difference .)

<h3><a name="k10d">K10D vs K20D res comparision</a></h3>

<p>About a year ago I took my tripod to my local camera store and shot some test pix with the K10D and the 16-45/f4. Today I went back to the same spot with the K20D and 16-45/f4 (and tripod) to try to re-create the same sequence. My purpose here is to provide a bit of objective evidence for those of you who own the K10D and feel tempted to upgrade. We already know that ISO and DR are not particularly different between the two cameras, leaving resolution and 12-bit vs 14-bit colour. Colour will have to wait for another day, since I need the same overcast sky of the K10D test to take a stab at that. However, we can get at least a preliminary feel for the difference in resolution. We know from the dpreview testing that the K10D was at the top of the 10 mp class in resolution. Here are crops from the same scene taken with the K10D and the K20D:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K10D_28mm_f8_crop_sz600x600.jpg" width=600 height=600 BORDER=4></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 31: K10D, 28mm @f/8 crop (Full size, level 12, 6.0 mp JPEG <a href="images/K10D-Henrys_test-20070427-28mm-ISO200-0368-full_size_no_edit.jpg">here</a> for full size)

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D_28mm_f8_crop_sz600x600.jpg" width=600 height=600 BORDER=4></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 32: K20D, 28mm @f/8 crop (Full size, level 12, 5.4 mp JPEG <a href="images/K20D-Henrys_test-20080320-28mm-ISO100-1222-full_size_no_edit.jpg">here</a> for full size)

<p>Click on the links to the full size JPEGs for un-edited JPEGs exported from Lightroom with no sharpening or other adjustments, to evaluate them for yourself. Ignore the contrast and colour between the two crops, since lighting conditions were not the same. For the above crops, I up-sampled the K10D file to the same size as the K20D file to make it easier to do visual comparison. I also sharpened both as best I could, although, as you can see, the K10D crop just doesn't want to come clean.

<p>I don't think there's much question that the K20D's increase in fine detail is palpable. Where there is a question is which K10D owners will benefit from that increase. The above shots were taken on a tripod with mirror lock-up at f/8 (the sweet spot of most lenses), they contain subject matter such as distant bare branches and overhead wires that can benefit from the extra resolution. Given that all these conditions are met, then, yes: the K20D will allow you to make a bigger print than the K10D, or a more-finely detailed medium-size print. To me, this would seem to be of more concern to those who do landscape and group portraits then to those who do family events and sports, for example.
