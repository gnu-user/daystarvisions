<p><b>Update 22 Mar '08</b>: The results in this review regarding resolution and colour are very sensitive to the lens used: the Pentax 16-45 f/4. Thanks to Lori Buhlman at Henry's in Pickering I was able to test the Sigma 17-70 f/2.8-4.5 with disappointing results. This could easily be due to a bad sample; but nevertheless, it highlights that a camera of this sensitivity requires pro-grade glass to perform at peak.

<p class=NoteBox><b>Concept</b>: This review is a work in progress. New material will be added over time and previous material may be revised. This review covers aspects of the Pentax K20D from the perspective of a landscape and a street photographer, shooting predominantly RAW files. I am not competent in and do not cover other domains, such as sports/action, photojournalism, studio, and flash.<br><br>

This is also an interactive review: rather than leave you to try to sort out my biases from the facts, I provide full-size image files so you can form your own conclusions. 

<p class=NoteBox><b>Procedural note 1</b>: Feel free to contact me if I'm not addressing concerns you have or if you feel my methodology or analysis is in error. 

<p class=NoteBox><b>Procedural note 2</b>: Key images throughout this review have a link for a full-size version for your evaluation. Unless otherwise noted, these images were processed from the RAW file in Lightroom using minimal settings, including linear curve, no NR, and no USM, then converted to JPEG in Photoshop at the highest level yielding a file size under 5 mp (usually level 10 or 11). I also plan to put up sample RAW files on this <a href="http://raw.fotosite.pl/">useful site</a> once I'm more sure I'm getting the most out of the camera.

<p>A month ago I wrote a backgrounder called <a href="//daystarvisions.com/Docs/Tuts/LandCam/pg1.html">Shopping for a Landscape Camera</a>, explaining why I was excited enough by the specs of the Pentax K20D to pre-order it. Now that the camera is in my hands, my next task is to evaluate it. One reason I shop locally whenever possible &ndash; in this case at <a href="http://www.henrys.ca">Henry's</a> &ndash; is the ability to return for a full refund within 14 days. I need to find out whether I'm going to keep this camera (whether it lives up to its promise) in that short time. The results I come up with may be of interest to those specifically considering a K20D. As well, the methodology I use may be of use to those of you who are fairly new to photography who may find themselves shopping for a camera now or in days to come.

<p>I'm going to divide this task into two broad areas: usability and image quality (IQ).

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 2: Me and the K20D

<p>The camera arrived on an early March Friday ... but so did a huge blizzard here in southern Ontario. This was somewhat frustrating given it's hard to take a sweeping landscape shot to evaluate a camera's fine detail rendition when falling snow is filling the air. So I contented myself with this shot through my bedroom window and moved on:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-Test-0743_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0743_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>

<h3 class="Left"><a name="handling">Handling &ndash; first impressions</a></h3>

<p>In heft and size the K20D is right in the mainstream of 35mm SLRs going right back to the Nikon F &ndash; about 2 pounds and a hand's-length across. This is just right for me: enough heft to balance a fairly serious lens but not so much that I can't tote it for hours without noticing it's there. Also just right is the firmness of the various knobs and buttons; no chance of the mode dial or on/off dial rotating in the camera bag, for example. The finder is the same excellent pentaprism view Pentax has distinguished itself with since the first *ist D. The shutter release sound is meaty and about average in volume (meaning: not something you'd want to hear while a minister is saying "do you take this man to be your..."). 

<p>The first task when getting a new digital camera is to plug the battery in the charger then plow through the manual. In this case over 150 action-packed pages of almost-reasonable English. (Actually, the main language problem is not that the manual was written by a non-native speaker; but that it was written in non-technical language. Kind of hard to talk about dynamic range or exposure latitude when you can't actually <i>use</i> either of those terms.) The manual is so long because the camera has so many features. What a camera is today is actually a full-scale software application, like the browser you're reading this in, running on a dedicated computer with some specialized and integrated peripheral devices like a sensor and a lens. Thus, using a modern camera has become as much a software learning-curve challenge as a hardware challenge. Now, you might think that you could just set the camera in manual exposure plus manual focus and away you go &ndash; but, no: you have to learn how to change the ISO, change the default 1 sec. display time for the image you just exposed on the monitor to something actually usable, etc., etc. One upside to this is the impressive range of customization options in the menu system.

<!--p>Also, since I owned and loved a previous-model Pentax dSLR, you'd think I would already know how to do something as simple as AF lock, but no: they couldn't leave well enough alone. Things you didn't want changed have been changed; and things you wanted changed are left the same.-->

<h4>(Naggy little) things that should not have been changed but were</h4>

<p>(Incidentally, I'm coming from the Pentax DS, having skipped the K10D, so much of what I say about the physical aspects of the K20D likely applies to that camera as well.)

<ul>
<li>The battery door and memory card door have fussy little flip-up tabs that have to be rotated. The memory card door tab is something I use frequently and never without fear of snapping it off. Besides which, it rotates the wrong way and is hard to work with in difficult conditions. 
<li>Exposure compensation has a -3/+3 range in 1/2 stops but only a -2/+2 range in 1/3 stops. The change that was needed was to add more range, not take away range. If the Pentax engineering team wants proof that their pattern metering algorithm can be off by more than two stops (or any other brand's, for that matter), I'll be glad to <a href="//daystarvisions.com/Docs/Tuts/MultiMeter/pg1.html">provide it</a>.
</ul>

<h4>Things that should have been changed but weren't</h4>

<ul>
<li>This one deserves a new acronym, so unless someone can come up with a better term, I'll call it Highlight Protection Metering or HPM (related to but not quite the same as expose-to-the-right). Because the latitude of digital cameras is finite, every photographer past kindergarten has one over-riding concern: to let as much light as possible hit the sensor just short of blowing non-specular highlights. This is why we have blinking blown-highlight display and in-camera histograms. Why not just provide a dedicated HPM mode and be done with it? As my father would say: Sheesh!
</ul>

<h4>Things that should have been changed and were</h4>

<ul>
<li>ISO. Three things effect exposure in equal measure: aperture, shutter, and ISO. All three need to be visible in the finder and all three need to be easily modified. Why has this been such a difficult concept for camera designers to grasp? Finally, Pentax, at least, gets it (nearly) right. With a custom function that eluded me at first, one can opt to display ISO instead of frame count in both the finder and the upper LCD (frame count shows for a second after each exposure). As another nice touch, another custom function allows you to set either thumb wheel to change ISO in Tv and Av. Since I live in Av, this means I change the aperture with one wheel as usual, but with the other I change the ISO or set the exposure comp. depending on whether I'm holding down the exp. comp. button or no.
<li>User setting on the mode dial. I really longed for this when I had the Pentax DS. In situations in which I was working with moving subjects, I wanted to use Av and pattern metering. Working with relatively static subjects like landscape, I used Manual or Av and spot metering. So now Pentax gives me the ability to store settings and switch to them by thumbing the mode dial. Problem is that some key settings aren't covered, especially meter mode and AF mode. Presumably, that's because they have dedicated buttons, and changing them via the User mode setting would create a mismatch between what the camera is doing and what the dedicated button is showing. 
<li>AE/AF-lock is now two separate buttons. That's a good thing for the way I work; but I'm finding that it's a hard habit to re-learn.
</ul>

<h4>Things that were changed and/or added that sort-a leave me scratching my head</h4>

<ul>
<li>Sv and TAv. (Yes: I know these were in the K10D, but I'm coming from the DS.) I expect to some day have a moment of epiphany as to why Sv sits there on the mode dial. I actually used TAv, however. Taking test shots out the window of the commuter train, I wanted the fastest possible shutter speed, and wanted the fastest aperture, as well, but didn't consider ISO to be critical. 
</ul>

<p>An interesting addition that I'm not quite sure into which of the above categories it belongs is live view. Over time I assume I'll come to have an opinion on what to do with it, but so far no bells have rung. It's quite true that you can hold the camera at arm's length overhead and still see what's on the monitor, but I attend very few parades and rock concerts...

<p>What's driving me crazy right now is finding the dinky AF, +/- (Exp. Comp.), and AE-L (Exp. Lock) buttons with my right thumb. Presumably my hand will get used to them in time. 

<p class=Notebox><b>How to take a picture with the K20D</b><br><br>

Probably a topic of study for a lifetime, but here's what I've come up with so far, based on Av mode. I used the custom settings menu to assign EV comp and ISO to one scroll wheel and of course aperture to the other when the mode dial is set to Av. I also turned off AF on the shutter release button half-press, leaving it assigned to the AF button.<br><br>

<b>Rush shots</b>: (no time to check exposure, etc.) I put the meter on pattern, the AF mode dial on centre, check the aperture if I have the luxury of that much time, press the AF button with the part of the scene I want to focus on centered in the the finder, compose, adjust ISO via scroll wheel if needed, then shoot.<br><br>

<b>More leisurely shots</b>: I switch the meter to spot, switch the mode dial to User, which has +2 EV/comp dialed in, meter off the brightest spot in the scene, check that my aperture is what I want for DOF push the exposure lock button (= expose-to-right metering), then use ISO to get my shutter speed in the appropriate ball park. In theory I would compose next, then do focusing as above with the AF button but in addition select the appropriate focus point; in practice I am more likely to stick to the centre focus point.<br><br>

It only <i>sounds</i> complicated... 

<h3 class="Left">Image Quality &ndash; first impressions</h3>

<h4><a name="Res">IQ 1: Resolution and acutance</a></h4>

<p>After leaving behind over a foot of snow, the storm cleared Saturday night, leaving me with perfect blue sky no wind weather on Sunday:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/K20D-Test-0833_sz950x631.jpg"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0833_sz600x399.jpg" width=600 height=399 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 4: Shovelling ahead (100 ISO, tripod) (Full size 4.8 mp JPEG <a href="image/K20D-Test-0833_full_no_edit.jpg">here</a>)

<p>First things first, Fig. 4 was intended for the single purpose of finding out how large a print the K20D is good for under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions meaning tripod, low ISO, sweet spot of the lens (28mm @ f/8), mirror lock-up, RAW capture, bright light, and no wind. Having spent years doing wooded landscapes, the bare branches of distant trees is the most demanding subject matter I'm familiar with for sheer resolution and what I prefer to use for detail evaluation. The ash tree just right of the big fir is what I focused on and is about 60 feet away from the camera.

<p>One downside of being the first kid on the block with a new camera is that the raw converters haven't yet caught up. Pentax Laboratory is the kiddie toy that ships with the camera. But a beta release of SilkyPix supports the K20D both PEF and DNG, and my main squeeze, Lightroom, knows DNG, but doesn't have any profiles for this particular camera. I downloaded a trial version of SilkyPix, found the interface just as obscure as ever, but managed to establish that Lightroom wasn't having any problems interpreting K20 DNGs, at least in the resolution department. So I cranked out a PSD file, sent it to Photoshop, and applied the least invasive USM I could come up with to crispen up the acutance: Amount/Radius/Threshold 500/0.2/0 then 375/0.2/0 then a titch at 0.3. As you can see from Fig. 5, this very minimal dose of USM was enough to clean up the edges nicely:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG src="images/K20D-Test-0833-crop1_sz600x600.jpg" width=600 height=600 BORDER=4>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: Actual pixels (100% mag.) crop (minimal USM)

<p>Then I set the ppi to an even 200 to give a print size of 15.5" x 23.3", took an 11" x 17" crop from that, put a sheet of 13" x 19" RC paper in my printer (Epson 3800), and hit Print. Ten minutes later I was holding a piece of paper that fairly boggled my mind. A friend of mine and sometime guest artist on this site does a combination of 6x7 medium format and 4x5 large format with fine-grained slide film scanned at 2500 ppi then printed to sizes like 18" x 22". That's the kind of detail and sheer image quality I'm seeing when I look at this test print. I then printed the entire frame at 288 ppi for a 10.8" x 16.2" image, fully expecting from past experience to be even more impressed with the finer scale detail ... but I wasn't. The second print was just smaller; there was no sense of more closely approaching contact print goodness. Now that's a lot to try to take away from two prints from one image file, but it certainly augers well for the future. 

<p>[<b>Note</b>: a week later, after printing several images, I can well affirm that this is indeed no fluke. Steady, well-exposed landscapes at ISOs from 100 to 400 are stunning at 16" x 24" (A2) print sizes. After some reflection I've begun to think of the K20D's image files as being the equivalent of 10x15"/300 ppi contact prints; and enlarging by a mere 2x isn't much of a hit.]
