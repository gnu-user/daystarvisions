<H1>The Pentax K20D: a critical diary</H1>

<h4>IQ 3: Latitude/DR and noise</h4>

<p>Much has been made on-line about the supposed improvements of the K20D in these areas. For latitude, the camera has a dynamic range boost function called D-Range available in the Fn button menu. There is also a JPEG-specific HDR processing option. For noise, the idea is that the increased pixel count of the K20D (14.6 mp) over the K10D (10 mp) comes without the expected penalty of increased noise at a given ISO. 

<p>Looking into D-Range first, the best I can find is about a 0.4 stop extension of highlight latitude, but with an equivalent loss in shadow latitude in some shots. Another datum is that D-Range cannot be applied to the 100 ISO, which is the camera's slowest ISO setting. These facts suggests that nothing more is going on here than underexposure combined with a development curve that bulges a bit in the middle zones.

<p>To illustrate the HDR (high dynamic range) option I went into the in-camera development menu and converted the DNG file for Fig. 3 into an HDR JPEG. This site is rated G, so I can't show you the result unless you sign a disclaimer saying you accept responsibility for any damage your eyesight may incur from viewing this level of violence, then click <a href="images/K20D-Test-0833_sz600x399_HDR.jpg">here</a>.

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: K20D's in-camera HDR-->

I'm sure there is someone somewhere who will appreciate this innovation... (Incidentally: the super-saturation and cyan hue shift are courtesy of the K20D's JPEG processing engine. Enjoy.)

<p>This seemingly innocuous shot is the method I've been using for years now to extract latitude and noise confessions from reluctant cameras:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 7: Dale's torture test (100 ISO)

<p>This was shot in raw at 100 ISO with manual exposure set to just blow the highlights in the brightest part of the frame &ndash; in this case the left window edge. To the human eye the room interior was reasonably well lit, while the left window edge was glaring. To the camera, as we see, everything but that window edge is shrouded in darkness.

<p>Here is the same shot but this time with a curve applied to open things up (although the shadow areas are still nothing like as bright as my eye sees them when I look at this scene):

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 8: Brighter view

<p>The red numbers are EVs (exposure values) metered with my trusty old Seiko Digi-Spot handheld lightmeter. The big 16 is where the highlights blow and all the other EVs are darker. If we subtract the red 5.0 in the maw of my silver and black Epson inkjet from 16 we get 11, which tells us that that part of the scene is 11 stops dimmer than the left window edge. As we would expect, we can see in Fig. 9 there is no detail, only noise at 11 stops:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 9: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 11 stops

<p>More troubling is that noise is noticeably present even at a mere 6.5 stops:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 10: Close-up showing 100 ISO noise at 6.5 stops

<p>This little noise cleans up easily with a bit of noise reduction, but it portends that high ISO shooting isn't going to be a bed of roses. 

<p>The window shot tells us that we can ignore DR beyond 8 stops, so for the ISO testing, I'll use a somewhat less extreme scene:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 11: ISO test scenario

<p>I shot the above frame in RAW on a tripod at ISOs from 100 to 6400 then developed each frame in Lightroom with the same minimalist settings, including a linear curve and zero noise reduction. I've shown EV measurements in red again, but this time in white I've shown the number of stops departure from the blowout point (EV 10 on the lamp) for each EV reading. The white rectangle is the area we'll examine at full size, since it covers a good range of EVs for noise handling. Click on Fig. 12 for a large (1.5 mb) high-quality JPEG showing this crop from 100 to 6400 ISO: 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="images/ISO_noise_levels_sz833x1555.jpg"><IMG src="images/ISO_noise_levels_sz416x777.jpg" width=416 height=777 BORDER=8></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 12: ISO test results (click pic for full size)

<p>What we see is that there is minor shadow noise at 100 ISO; at 200 noise is barely perceptible in the mid-tones and not bad in the shadows; at 400 noise is quite noticeable in the mid-tones and serious in the shadows; and it quickly slides down hill from there. 400 ISO is recoverable using a good noise reducer like Noise Ninja with no perceptible loss of detail; 800 is recoverable with a slight loss of detail; 1600 is recoverable with significant loss of detail; 3200 and 6400 are not fully recoverable &ndash; serious noise artifacts will remain no matter how aggressively you sic noise reduction on the file.

<p>Given the noise we see at 3200, let alone 6400, we might think these extreme settings are useless, but see here:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 13: DC8-22, 6400 ISO

<p>The combination of high ISO and image stabilization made for a handheld grab shot that proved quite a meaty bone to toss in the direction of Photoshop. I got technically better frames at the same place/time at lower ISOs, but none nearly so interesting to my eye. The wonderful starring around the street lights only happens at 6400 and you get wonderfully gritty film-like grain in the bargain:

<h3>IQ first impressions recap</h3>

<p>What this all means is that resolution/acutance is the K20's trump card; DR/noise is not. As long as you want to work with 100 to 400 ISO, you've got a medium format equivalent camera in your hands. As soon as you cross into 800 and above territory, you're starting to deal with film-like graininess. DR is definitely on the tight side &ndash; more like 7 stops than 9. This means that in high contrast lighting, including back-lighting &ndash; and assuming you expose to preserve highlights &ndash; you have the choice of leaving your shadow areas punchy and dark or opening them up and dealing with the noise lurking therein. If you prefer DR handling over res, the Nikon D300 with it's 9 stops latitude and 12.3 megapixels may be just the box for you.
