<h3>Confirmation</h3>

<p>As I've stated repeatedly this is a pragmatic review. I know something about how to take a photograph, but am not any kind of expert in engineering matters. It was therefore a great relief to me to have some confirmation that I haven't strayed too far from the course in the results I've reported so far. I hope to present this material more formally at some point, but for now see <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1036&message=27189845">this post</a> to the Pentax SLR forum of dpreview.com for some very acute analysis of the K20D's capabilities. 

<h3>An interim op/ed &ndash; who's this beast for?</h3>

<p>The most likely reason you're reading this review is that you are considering purchasing the K20D. After all the verbal and visual content I've thrown at you thus far, together with the barrage of your own thoughts arising from that and other content, it would be easy to lose sight of a simple concept. As they say in jolly old England: horses for courses. The first thing that stands out about the K20D is that it has a 14.6 megapixel imager. We all went through years of severe megapixel rationing and are all still a bit over-sensitive to the issue of not having enough pixels/resolution for a given print size, so 14.6 has the same sort of instant appeal as the words &quot;long tall cold one&quot; do after a sweaty work out on a hot day. Hold that thought for a sec.

<p>The second thing that jumps out about the K20D is that those 14.6 megapixels are crammed into an APS-C sensor, not a FF sensor (let alone an MF sensor). If you evenly divide a fixed sensor area into more pixels, then of course each pixel has to be smaller, and each pixel has to have less light gathering surface area. Therefore the expectation would be that an increase in pixel count would come at the cost of a <i>decrease</i> in signal-to-noise ratio; to put it simply: more but lower-quality pixels per image per ISO level. 

<p>So now the third thing that jumps out about the K20D is Pentax' claim that due to sensor design improvements the increase in pixel count has <b>not</b> resulted in a higher signal-to-noise ratio. My empirical testing over the past three pages matches the no-holds-barred technical analysis of some brighter bulbs than mine that this is indeed at least approximately the case. These are 14.6 million very useful pixels per image file we have here ... and that's finally enough with which to make 16x24/A2 prints of even the most challengingly high-detailed subject matter. Prints that have to apologize for <i>nothing</i> in the way of image quality, and smaller prints than that are just that much better.

<p>But wait! There's more! Not only can the K20D give us superb large prints, it can also do so <i>handheld</i>! Thanks to Pentax' early-on we-try-harder thinking they now have a mature and incredibly useful image stabilization system built into the camera body. And in spite of the larger file size the camera responds instantly to your least command and loses nothing in frames-per-sec over last year's model. Plus, the finder is excellent and it's packed with nifty usability bonuses like in-camera RAW-to-JPEG conversion. 

<p>Now back to megapixel rationing and horses for courses. The problem here is that you may not be in a branch of photography for which sumptuous 16x24/A2 printing is of any great relevance. Not a lot of baby's-first-birthday nor we-saw-the-Eiffel-Tower nor Rugby-action nor motorsports-hair-raiser nor dental-reconstruction shots are going to be printed at those sizes or examined for that level of aesthetic goodness at any size. 

<p>18 months ago Pentax and Samsung made a tactical decision that by the time 2008 rolled around the camera they wanted to bring to market would need to have at least 14 megapixels to compete in the semi-pro arena. Here we are in 2008 and behold: the semi-pro competition opted to go with 12 megapixels for APS-C, and improve in other areas, such as high ISO, DR, and frame rate. Again: Pentax managed it's 14.6 APS-C megapixel minor miracle without going backward in those other areas ... but it didn't go forward in those areas either. If you can benefit from the extra resolution and don't need more/better ISO, DR, frame rate, etc. than last year's model (and few of us do), then you're laughing.

<p>So far as I can tell, the semi-pro/APS-C dSLR is at a fork in the road. There needs to be a new specialization such that manufacturers do for the semi-pro photographer what they've long done for the pro. There is a Canon 1DIII for action work and a Canon 1DSIII for detail work, a Nikon D3 for action work and there will surely soon be a Nikon D3X for detail work. In the semi-pro arena the same thinking should prevail. So far as I can see 8 megapixels is plenty for action work. If the manufacturers would just wise up and start applying the same advances to 8 megapixel APS-C scale imagers &ndash; reducing noise, increasing ISO and frame rate to incredible heights &ndash; they'd really have something. 

<p>The Canon 40D and Nikon D300 are semi-pro models that try to be jacks-of-all trades. Good but not superb high ISO, DR, resolution, frame rate, etc. An action shooter rarely wants 12 megapixels and the detail shooter rarely wants 6 frames per sec, so the Canon and Nikon approach represents a compromise all around. They missed out on the opportunity to really please any segment of the market. 

<p>In the K20D Pentax at least has their optimized-for-detail specialist camera. Now they need to apply their collective cleverness to creating a parallel, optimized for action, semi-pro line. Unfortunately, as (a distant) number 3 in sales, we know they just don't have the resources to pursue parallel semi-pro lines. In that wise, the decision to shoot for 14+ megapixels was a mistake, since Canon and Nikon did not make the expected push to that height. A mistake in sales terms, at least. For those of us who do landscape, group portraiture, product shots on a budget, etc., it's a delightful windfall.
