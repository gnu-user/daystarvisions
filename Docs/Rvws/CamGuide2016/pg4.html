<h2>Interchangeable Lens Camera Manufacturer Report</h2>

<h3>Canon</h3>

<p>Strengths: best all-around shooting experience. Excellent range of relatively affordable lenses. Excellent AF for action. Excellent service and support. </p>

<p>Weaknesses: sensors are (visually) noisier, so some limitations in dynamic range and high ISO reach exist at the extremes. No serious mirrorless options. SLRs tend to be large and hefty. </p>

<p>Notable options: 7D mark II is a large APS-C body with superb handling, and excellent IQ despite not class-leading dynamic range. SL1 is perhaps the world's smallest dSLR but very well respected all the same (The SL2 is rumoured to replace it soon.)</p>

<h3>Nikon</h3>

<p>Strengths: best image quality. Most Nikon models use a Sony sensor and manage to eke out a bit more image quality than Sony does. Excellent but pricey lens line. Good-to-excellent AF for action. </p>

<p>Weaknesses: often limited buffer and low-light focusing. Often problems with interface design. No competitive mirrorless option. Terrible service and support. Don't know whether to suggest not buying an extended warranty as a waste of money. Or definitely buying one, being prepared for frustration/disappointment in the results, and for selling the camera before end-of-warranty-term. </p>

<p>Notable options: D750 is Nikon's best all-around camera, 24 MP full frame. D7200 is APS-C 24 MP, somewhat smaller and less expensive.</p>

<h3>Sony</h3>
<p>(Note: Sony entered the interchangeable lens camera market by purchasing and absorbing the former Minolta camera company.) </p>

<p>Strengths: best sensors, best miniaturization tech, and greatest focus on innovation. The superb lens company, Zeiss, produces pricey but excellent lenses for Sony cameras. </p>

<p>Weaknesses: Sony is forever starting new product lines then abrubtly abandoning them, so continually floods the market with a bewildering array of fascinating but flawed products. As a very large company, Sony has virtually no interest in customer concerns and tends to have a poor reputation for customer support services. The current contraction in the photography market has forced Sony's camera division to at least start mouthing platitudes of customer focus. There are even occasional signs of changes happening due to customer demand, but only when it doesn't impact Sony's bottom line. Because Sony's camera division always has access to the latest generation of Sony's sensor division's best-of-class sensors, one would think Sony cameras would have the best image quality going. In fact, Nikon nearly always manages to get a few percent better image quality from Sony sensors than Sony does itself.</p>

<p>Noteable options: A7R mark II is Sony's ultra-expensive full frame, 42 MP body, which has been generally very well received. The older and original A7 model, is simply the smallest, lightest interchangeable lens full frame camera avaiable, with excellent image quality at 24 MP and very nice handling. Perhaps also the least expensive. The APS-C, 24 MP A6000 has been extremely well received, is due for replacement, and is continually on sale. (The normal 16-50 kit zoom is highly flawed; the older 18-55 zoom should be purchased instead.)</p>

<h3>Pentax</h3>

<p>Strengths: superb user interface. Excellent line of prime lenses. Good to decent support, at least in Canada. </p>

<p>Weaknesses: Small market share, seemingly in danger of extinction as camera market contracts. No serious mirrorless options. No full frame SLR. Zoom lens line-up is spotty.</p>

<p>Notable options: 645Z is the only larger-than-full-frame or medium format camera available in an at all affordable price. Very well respected. All it's current APS-C dSLRs are fine but due for replacement.</p>

<h3>Olympus</h3>

<p>Strengths: wide array of lenses with excellent optics. Smallish, versatile camera bodies.</p>

<p>Weaknesses: small sensors (micro 4/3rds) have built-in limitations on resolution (currently 16 megapixels), ISO (6400 is iffy), and dynamic range. No SLR options. Small market share but not showing signs of flat-lining. </p>

<p>Notable options: EM5, EM5 mark II, EM10 are all similar in size and features with award-winning capabilities. EM1 is even better but is more expensive. All are 16 MP.</p>

<h3>Panasonic</h3>

<p>Much the same story as Olympus. Sensors have been noisier in the past than the best of the competition, but that seems to have changed. Panasonic excels at producing cameras with excellent video capabilities. G7 is an excellent and versatile, fairly low priced, 16 MP camera. </p>

<h3>Fujifilm</h3>

<p>Strengths: small player but very attentive to customer feedback. Provides extensive firmware upgrades that keep older models from going obsolete. Excellent lens quality. </p>

<p>Weaknesses: Fuji uses a proprietary sensor design with some serious limitations that show under certain conditions, much denied by its fan base. Produces only APS-C mirrorless cameras. </p>

<p>Notable options: I can't honestly recommend any of the Fuji bodies with their proprietary sensor. Their XA1 is well regarded but doesn't have a viewfinder.</p>
