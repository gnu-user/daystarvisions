<p class="MessageBox"><b>My slant</b>: I shot Nikon film SLRs for several years, then Pentax dSLRs for several years. Purchasing the D7000 is my first experience with a Nikon dSLR, which gives me a rather different perspective on the camera experience. My photographic experience is in the microcosms of landscape, candids, and motion blur/abstract, all done using existing light. I have no experience whatsoever with sports or wildlife or studio or flash. This means my in-camera flash never pops up and my use of AF is limited to single shot centre-point only. I always shoot raw and post process as needed.</p>

<h2><a name="Rationale">Why buy an APS-C dSLR?</a></h2>

<p>One of the commonest clich&eacute;s in photography is that the best camera is the one you have with you. The <b><i>ultimate</i></b> best camera would have the image quality (IQ) of an 80 MP Phase One, the frame rate of a Nikon D3s, the high ISO capability of a Nikon D700, a fixed 16-500 f/1.0 zoom, and fit in your shirt pocket like a Canon S95. Sadly, there is no indication such a camera is headed to market as I write this. The question the various manufacturers ask you is: what compromise are you willing to accept?</p>

<p>One solution would be to buy the camera and lenses with the very best image quality you can afford (perhaps a full frame dSLR) and take that out the door whenever you know you'll actually be shooting, then carry a pocket cam all the rest of the time. Problem is: the IQ of the pocket cam &ndash; or lack of an essential feature like decent high ISO or a long enough focal length &ndash; can be a hard pill to swallow. So the pocket cam may indeed get out the door but rarely get out of the pocket.</p>

<p>Another would be to own just one camera but make it one that's light enough in weight that carrying it around all day is not a form of torture. Many people feel that any SLR would fail that test and so look to the new product category of mirrorless. Then they complain endlessly about the pokey AF and/or compromised view finder and/or mediocre IQ of their chosen mirrorless. While they're complaining they buy an increasing number of cute little lenses and lug them around ... then soon find their camera bag is hefty enough that it's no longer a no-brainer whether it goes out the door.</p>

<p>Yet there was an era in the history of photography when none of this was an issue. Back then you bought a 35mm camera body, stuck the 50mm lens kit lens on the front, stuck that combo in a form-fitting case with shoulder strap, and slung that over your shoulder. Total weight: slightly less than 2 lbs (1 kg).  Strangely, that's the same weight as a D7000 + kit 18-105 (or D7000 + 18-200 or D7000 + two primes). An alternative would be to buy a D5100 or D3100 and their kit lenses, but then you're getting into a cluster of compromises like a smaller, dimmer finder and crippled control set that starts to put you in mirrorless territory.</p>

<p>Fig. 2: Then and now: 50mm + holster bag + Nikon FM vs.18-105 + holster bag + D7000</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p class="MessageBox">The upshot is: buy a good APS-C dSLR + <b><i>one</i></b> good but light lens, put that in a shoulder bag, then <b><i>take it with you</i></b> whenever you go out the door. Problem solved. ;)</p>

<p>So the question becomes: if the D7000 a good enough camera body for your needs and is the default 18-105 a good enough lens for your needs? Let's get the second half of that question out of the way first...</p>

<h2><a name="Lenses">Lenses</a></h2>

<p>The 18-105 being a kit 3.5 to 5.6 does not lend one to confidence. If bokeh and speed are essential to how you do photography you'd automatically give it's 3.5-5.6 a pass. If long tele is essential to what you do, ditto. But for everything else I've tested the begeezus out of it and have been blown away at every turn. I have a pricey Nikkor 35-70 f/2.8 from my film days that I was planning to use for landscape work in spite the crop factor robbing me of its wide end. Now, many regard the 35-70 as one of the very sharpest moderate lenses &ndash; prime or zoom &ndash; Nikon ever created; but all it gives me is maybe a one or two percent improvement in detail over the 18-105 across the 35-70 range, and surprisingly at least a stop less transmittance. I also have a 28mm f/2.8 AIS Nikkor prime. The 18-105 runs circles around it. Not only is the 18-105 sharp, it has virtually no corner distortion except at the widest focals, and there it's as good as anything I've seen. Plus, the combination of 18-105 on D7000 has just the right heft and perfect balance to my tastes. Add that to the equivalent 28-105mm coverage and, frankly, I can't see why I'd ever take it off the front of my camera.</p>

<p>But my needs aren't your needs. Here's a beautiful tool for finding the right lens: <a href="http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops.aspx?Lens=665&Camera=614&Sample=0&FLI=0&API=0&LensComp=667&CameraComp=0&FLIComp=0&APIComp=0">The-Digital-Picture.com lens comparison tool</a></p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Caveat</b>: Another photographic clich&eacute; is to choose a camera system based on the extent of its lens selection, and Nikon has a huge selection to choose from. Only problem with that statement is that it's more true if you shoot 35mm or digital FF (full frame) than if you shoot DX (APS-C). Nikon's DX options are less than exhaustive, particularly at high-end wide angle. The 18-105 more than covers my current needs, but others may want to double-check before blindly assuming Nikon makes everything they need.</p>

<h2><a name="Construction">Body 1: Handling and Construction</a></h2>

<p>I approached shopping for a dSLR this time 'round with all the enthusiasm I'd muster for replacing the toaster. My attitude toward dSLRs had increasingly become that they are too big, too heavy, too loud, and too plasticky. In short: a necessary evil when high IQ is required. I ruled out other brands and models for a cluster of reasons that are not likely too apply to anyone else, and so plopped down the bucks on the D7000 + kit zoom ... from a store with a no-questions-asked two week return policy. Essential, given how many unknowns there were for me in the purchase equation.

<p>My first priority was learning an alien interface, then the next was putting the D7000 through its IQ paces, so I really didn't pay a lot of attention to it as a physical object. It gradually dawned on me, however, that the combination of body and lens had a really nice heft and balance in my hand. A bit later I realized I actually could get the dratted thing to do the things I needed it to do without too many contortions. Finally, in an epiphany moment I realized that the mat black carbon fibre and black textured rubber really didn't look all that bad and after all were what was keeping the weight down to a comfortable 2 lbs. In fact (I realized) the darned thing had grown on me and the intended marriage of convenience had become a marriage of love. It now seems to my affectionate eyes that the D7000 has more than a little of that aura of precision engineering that makes a Lexus outclass a Lada &ndash; not just in build but in responsiveness.</p>

<p>The real downside of the D7000 as a physical object is one it shares with all SLRs: the intimidation factor of its sheer size when doing un-posed people shots, especially street. Thus regrettably I still need to go out the door with a mirrorless or compact when people photography is on the agenda.</p>

<p>Another factor related to people photography is shutter release sound, which actually has more to do with the mirror up and return than the shutter. As with any SLR, you may as well snap your fingers as take an unexpected picture in a library or church using the D7000. The D7000 has a quiet shutter setting on its shutter mode dial that first appeared with the D300S. When you press the shutter release in Q mode the mirror goes up perhaps with a bit less violence but doesn't come back down until you ease off the button. So Q mode is more about breaking the sound event into two pieces than any substantial decrease in decibels of the over-all event. Here's another bit Nikon could crib from Pentax, who made a special effort to address this issue a few years back, and since the K-7 the Pentax shutter sound has been exceptionally quiet.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Forum concern: oil spills</b>: As I write this, Nikon forums are a-buzz with reports of oil splattering from the mirror mechanism and onto the sensor. My D7000 had several un-ringed spots showing on a standard defocused test shot when purchased; but enabling auto dust cleaning sent them packing and into my third week of ownership no sign of oil. The oil spot reports are pretty credible, but there's no way to estimate the frequency of the problem, which I'd guess to be a fraction of one percent. Plus, there's no way to know whether or not Nikon has made the necessary tweak to their assembly line to eliminate the problem.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Forum concern: softness</b>: Another hot topic on Nikon forums is image softness due to mirror slap. I'll address this extensively under <a href="IS">Image Sharpness</a>, below.</p>

<!--Vibration due to mirror slap and shutter motion is indeed enough to soften the 16 MP image output of this camera; and apparently some other camera models have better damped mirrors. The D7000 is targeted at a very fast 6 frames per second. Whether that rules out better damping I don't know, but the mirror vibrations intrude even a single shot rates. I picked up a forum tip to enable custom option D11, shutter delay, and that, combined with tripod and MLU, pretty much takes softness down to AA filter + lens imperfection territory. For shooting handheld shutter speeds over 1/500th combined with VR and regular shutter release comes pretty close to killing the softness issue. Adding quiet mode or even 2 sec delay doesn't help significantly. But the combination of VR + quiet mode + D11 delay does make a big difference.</p-->

<p>Fig. 4: D7000 controls</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Coming from a Pentax K-series dSLR, I started off missing the Pentax interface terribly. After a week (and with no thanks to the incredibly obtusely written manual) I managed to find acceptable work-arounds for the Pentax features I was so happy with.</p>

<p>The D7000 has by my count 28 buttons, dials, and levers plus no less than 50 specific control customization options in the menu. You'd think that would be enough to cover any conceivable need. If so, you've never shot with a Pentax dSLR. It may be hopelessly old-timey but some of us greybeards like to put a camera into manual mode and set focus, shutter, aperture, and ISO as separate events. If I set focus to distance X, I want the focus to stay at distance X until I darned well feel like changing it to distance Y. Ditto for the other variables. It's really not a bad way to work, and it can actually be faster, more flexible, and more responsive than any other shooting mode once you get over the culture shock ... and assuming the camera design doesn't get in the way.</p>

<p>The D7000 has the requisite two thumb wheels for shutter and aperture. ISO requires a peculiar combination of pressing a left-hand button on the back plus twirling a thumb wheel. But of course if you're such a fuss-budget that you can't leave ISO selection to the auto-ISO feature, then tough luck, right? If you want to do the fuss-budget thing for AF, then Nikon is right there with a custom option to set the AE-L/AF-L button to AF-Hold. Only problem is that I have totally average-sized hands yet the AE-L/AF-L button is just out of comfortable reach for my thumb. Now, if I could put AF-Hole on the Fn button or the DOF preview button ... but no, not in the cards. Finally, Pentax has a really sweet little green button just behind the shutter release. If does something nifty in Program mode; in Manual mode one press of the green button instantly resets my aperture to what the meter suggests. If I'm shooting a subject in direct sunlight and I have an aperture of 1/3000th, and then my subject slips into a shadow area so I need an aperture of 1/30th, no frantically thumbing the aperture wheel through thirteen or more clicks. Just press the green button once and you're laughing.</p>

<p>(In case you're wondering; the work-around I've settled on is fine, now that I'm used to it. I now work in aperture priority with spot metering on, compensation set to +2, AE-L on the Fn button, and AF-L on the shutter half-press.)</p>

<p>On the plus side, there are some interface decisions on the D7000 that I really like. Mirror lock-up is a two click process. If you move the mode dial to MLU, you're not simply blacked out in the finder. Instead, you can compose off the mirror as usual, then when you're ready to shoot you press the shutter release once to up the mirror, then a second time to take the shot. Tres nice. Deleting the current shot isn't a laborious process of pressing the trash button then the up arrow then the OK button. Two trash button presses and you're done. Bracketing doesn't require digging into menus to modify or to enable. Press the BKT button then thumb one thumb wheel to set the number of shots in the sequence, press the other to set the stop interval between them, and go. You can even fire each shot separately by choosing single shot instead of continuous.</p>

<p>Other things I like include the ease of saving all current settings as a U1 or U2 custom shooting mode. (Downside is that /all/ settings are included and I really don't want my ISO jumping from 3200 to 100 or some such whenever I want to invoke a custom mode.) Saving one's most frequently used menu options is handy, being able to scroll through the most recently used options is gravy.</p>

<h2><a name="AF">Body 3: Auto-focus</a></h2>

<p>As mentioned off the top, AF is something I'm not particularly competent to judge. the D7000 has enough AF options to sink a battleship and all I use is single centre point. Focus acquisition with the 18-105 is far from instantaneous yet not irritatingly slow. More importantly it works in every circumstance I've so far managed to throw at it. Plus, while the D7000 has a nice fine focus (back focus) tuning system, my particular unit doesn't need it with any lens I own.</p>

<p>Fig. 6: My eyeballs' recommended exposure of the same scene</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>This is the place where I'm suposed to insert a few words about the accuracy of the camera's exposure meter. Unfortunately, you've hit a site where the writer is an exposure accuracy fanatic. I regularly start frothing at the mouth when I even start to <b><i>think</i></b> about this subject. In parallel to this user report I'm also writing a piece on how to manage to get a usable exposure out of the D7000 (and by inference all other recent Nikon dSLRs). In short, the D7000 puts you through a few more hoops than the best of the competition (Pentax) but also a few less than the worst (Canon). But that's not something you should worry about unless you happen to agree with me as to what a proper exposure is &ndash; for example: if you actually prefer Fig. 6 to Fig. 5, above.</p>

<p>Anyhow, some objective facts are: the spot meter places an exposure of a middle-toned object at two stops below the blown highlight cut-off point (you can test this for yourself if you own one). This in spite the fact that the sensor has at least 10 stops of DR latitude to play with (see <a href="DR">below</a>). Another factoid: if you want to avoid blowing more than a quarter of the scene in even moderately contrasty light using the D7000's new-fangled colour matrix meter when you're working in any light less dead than the proverbial doornail, you'd best dial in at least a full stop of negative exposure compensation &ndash; and more is probably better. IOW, the matrix meter lives up there as close to the blown highlights Mendoza line as the spot meter does. An alternate approach if you can spare even a fraction of a second is not to use exposure comp, but to matrix meter off the brightest part of the scene, then press AE-L, then re-compose and shoot. For example, to get Fig. 6 above, I metered off the grey brick wall and locked that in as the exposure. Unfortunately, even this trick fails when something really bright like a blue sky with sunlit clouds dominates the scene.</p>

<h2><a name="IS">Body 5: Image Stabilization and Image Sharpness</a></h2>

<p>I long resisted lens-based IS on the theoretical ground that only those lenses so equipped would have that feature. In practice, on Pentax dSLRs at least, it takes about a full second for IS to kick in for each and every shot. Press the shutter before IS is fully up to speed and you get a peculiar partial-frame blur. In theory, you need to wait for lens-based IS to kick in as well, but in practice it seems instantaneous to me. </p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">
<img src="Blur_test_crops-sz620x640.jpg" width="620" height="640" alt="No larger version" />
<p>Fig. 5: Image blur for a variety of exposure methods</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>But neither image stabilization nor a tripod is necessarily a guarantee of avoiding the blur gremlins. As mentioned, Nikon forums have resounded with concerns about mirror slap causing blur. A sufficiently short expsoure time like 1/500th second solves the problem by not giving mirror-induced vibrations any time in which to jar things. Even on a tripod, film SLRs have long been known to have a danger zone from roughly 1/20th sec. on to a second or two in which mirror slap vibrations would be visible unless mirror lock-up was used. Shooting handheld, the longer the focal length the greater any mirror vibrations are amplified.</p>

<p>My own testing shows a simple steady progression of mirror vibration blur even with VR (image stabilization) active and standard shutter release at any focal length as shutter speeds get longer than 1/250th. Some nice forum research shows that this blur is more pronounced with the D7000 than in some other dSLRs with the same or greater resolution and with the same or greater maximum frame rate and identifies a lack of foam padding in the mirror box as a likely culprit. What you have to realize is that you're not going to see this unless you print at really large sizes.</p>

<p>If you do print large, then it's nothing new that you have to take extra care for maximum crispness, and Nikon has been particularly generous with tools to do that. When shooting handheld VR is a no-brainer, as is pushing for the shortest possible shutter speeds. In addition use Quiet mode whenever possible and add custom option D11 exposure delay for an even greater improvement. My own testing shows live view is a help but not so much as Quiet mode. On a tripod use MLU + D11 or a cable release. Two second timer is not shown here but is not as effective as D11. </p>

<h2><a name="Res">Image Quality 1: Resolution</a></h2>

<p>OK: I've got this nifty 16.2 megapixel sensor, so how does it perform? I'm not in a position to give you an actual number, but DPReviews are and that number is 2650 line pairs per picture height, which is disturbingly close to the 2700 to 2800 that full frame monsters like the Canon 5D II and the Sony A900 and the Nikon D3X weigh in at. What we can see from Fig. 5 J and K is that even the kit 18-105 when shot on a tripod at F/8 and at base ISO can get us right down to the minimum softness introduced by the anti-aliasing filter. That tells me that the no resolution is being swallowed up within the guts of the camera. And that means that, yes, you can get your 16.2 megapixels' worth of detail out of the camera if you're willing to put in the effort to do so.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Upgrading just for resolution</b>: On the other hand, as illustrated in the previous section, you need to jump through so many hoops to keep from losing half those megapixels to vibration blur and you need a good enough lens set to a small enough aperture, that the step up in resolution from the more common 12 MP sensor is not something most of us are going to see all that often.</p>

<h2><a name="DR">Image Quality 2: Dynamic Range and High ISO Noise</a></h2>

<p>The following dynamic range test shots were taken in raw, the developed in Lightroom with fill light at max and chroma noise reduction at max, then opened in Photoshop where I applied a very strong curve to open the shadows. I spot-metered to place the brightest part of the scene just shy of over-exposure. If you've ever taken a window shot like this that preserves highlights you know that everything surrounding the window is either ink-black or nearly ink-black, hence the huge boost to the shadow areas in post processing. It's not that we would do this in "real life"; it's just a ploy to let us see clearly the relative noise levels in the deepest shadows, and hence make a call at DR. I've marked exposure values (EVs) at various points:</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">

<p>Fig. 7. 100 ISO crops</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>As you can see from the Figs. 6 and 7, there is enough noise to cause mild granularity at EV 7.2 (DR = 7 stops). Colour bleeding starts at DR = 8 or so. But some degree of detail is still discernible down to an incredible DR = 10.5. The upshot is that if you work at base ISO expose carefully the D7000 will repay you with the same sort of latitude as a really good print film.</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">

<p>Fig 9. 1600 crops</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>At 1600 ISO, of course, things are a wee different. Colour bleeding has set in at DR = 5 stops, and noise has pretty much obliterated all shadow detail by DR = 9. Even more important for me is the almost complete lack of pattern noise at any ISO.</p>

<p>The increase in dynamic range is real enough. DR is hard to quantify because how much latitude a camera has at the shadow end depends on how much noise degradation you're willing to tolerate. For me, the D7000 has 10 usable stops DR at base ISO, up from 8.5 for my previous K20D. Corrolary to DR is high ISO performance. Reading the hype I was expecting almost D700 or D3 cleanness, but in reality I'm seeing a relatively modest 1-stop improvement over the previous generation of APS-C sensors. More important to me is the great improvement in pattern noise over the hideous banding I was getting from my Pentax. Figure 10 (lens cap shot at 6400 ISO then pushed 4 stops in Lightroom) shows that even at 6400 ISO pattern noise is only moderate and something you're not likely to see in the vast majority of even your high ISO images:</p>

<h2><a name="Colour">Image Quality 3: Colour Depth and Accuracy</a></h2>

<p>Last but not least, colour depth. Because our monitors are typically 8-bit sRGB devices and the dithering pattern of even the best inkjet printers hardly exceeds 8 bits per channel of subtlety, whether or cameras are 12-bit or 14-bit colour devices is something more obvious on a spec sheet than in daily experience. Where it does come visibly into play is when we start tossing away bit depth by upping the ISO level. Just as the D7000 gives me two stops more DR at any given ISO than my previous dSLR, so it also gives me a stop better colour response at each ISO. This, after all, is implicit in the DR and ISO numbers. You get better DR, at least in part, when you have a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), The less noise you have at a given signal boost (ISO increment) the higher you can go in ISO settings before you may as well not bother. And the few pixels that are wiped out by noise at any given ISO setting, the more pixels that are actually doing their job of reporting scene colour.</p>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">
<img src="Posterization-sz360x200.jpg" width="360" height="200" alt="No larger version" />
<p>Fig. 11: posterization at higher ISOs</p>
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>So if we less DR for each stop we increase ISO, so also we have fewer bits of real colour information per pixel for each stop we increase ISO. Even shooting at 400 ISO we can lose enough bits of colour information to cause a visible cartoonish colour degradation technically called posterization,  as we can see in Fig. 11.</p>

<p>Less obviously, we think of base ISO as being a totally clean signal, but that's far from the case. There is noise in any base ISO image even in the brightest areas; the darker you go into the shadows the fewer the photons being collected and the more obvious the system noise becomes. So there are real differences between cameras even at base ISO: it's just that it's so easy for software noise reduction to handle the noise that's there that we don't realize there ever was any noise to begin with. We may never see it, but it does affect the colour depth and therefore the colour gradation capability of a camera's output at base ISO. And again, that one-stop improvement of the D7000 over the last generation, shows up at base ISO as well as in lower light.</p>

<p>Another colour consideration is accuracy. I use the latest Lightroom to develop my raws, and I'm blown away by the default camera profile for the D7000. I did my own (single luminant) profile and can't see any difference by swapping between the two. I shoot raw instead of JPEG, but comparing the D7000's side-car JPEGs with Lightroom conversion in linear, all I had to do was drop the JPEG contrast parameter to minimum and leave saturation at the default to get very much that same highly realistic colour handling. Very nice.</p>

<h2><a name="Conclusion">Wrap-up</a></h2>

<p>In the opener I argued that a really good APS-C dSLR with one really good lens makes a compelling multi-purpose tool that's light enough to carry around all day but can produce images that meet pretty high standards on all counts. So the questions are whether the D7000 is a really good APS-C dSLR and whether the 18-105 kit lens is a really good lens. I've tried to supply enough objective information (except regarding AF and flash) that you can make your own call on both counts. For my part, my 15 no-ask return window has come and gone, I still have the camera, and I'm growing more enthusiastic about it by the day.</p>

<p>One thing that's not quantifiable is whether you find the styling and physicality of a particular object like a camera particularly appealing or not. I've had a long-standing prejudice against the moulded black plastic look of dSLRs, but the D7000 has managed to win me over even in that regard.</p>

<p>Still: even if you agree with me that the D7000 is a sweet piece of kit, if the premise is one body + lens combo to meet your carry-everywhere needs, why would you not instead opt for a smaller alternative like the Panasonic G3 or the Sony NEX-C3? After all, these are all 16 megapixel devices.</p>

<p>* Lens weight is for the kit zoom in each case.</p>

<p>It all depends on what compromises you're willing to make to bring your carry weight and size down. The GH2 is mirrorless, but the actual difference in weight is only 200 grams. Plus, you lose the superb 100% prism finder and take a big hit in both DR and low light capability. These could be acceptable trade-offs depending on your needs &ndash; but for a gain of only 200 grams? OK: the NEX is certainly lighter at 1/3 the weight. It contains the same sensor, so IQ should be the same, right? Not quite, sayeth DXO. More importantly, the NEX has no EVF option, and it's control set is so crippled you can't even do an exposure lock then re-compose.</p>

<p>You can explore the differences between these cameras with this <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/products/compare/side-by-side?products=nikon_d7000&products=panasonic_dmcgh2&products=sony_nexc3">feature side-by-side</a> on DPReview and with this <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/Cameras/Compare-Camera-Sensors/Compare-cameras-side-by-side/%28appareil1%29/680|0/%28appareil2%29/677|0/%28appareil3%29/715|0/%28onglet%29/0/%28brand%29/Nikon/%28brand2%29/Panasonic/%28brand3%29/Sony">IQ side-by-side</a> on DxOMark. (The DxOMark dynamic range numbers for the D7000 differ from mine mainly because they're reporting the number of stops to total signal loss &ndash; 13.9, while I'm reporting my personal take on how many of those stops are actually usable  &ndash; 10.5.)</p>
