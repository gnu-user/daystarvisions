<p class="MessageBox"><b>Target audience</b>: If this review is going to be of any use to you, you'll need to understand where I'm coming from. My experience is in the microcosms of landscape, candids, and motion blur/abstract, all done using existing light. I have no experience whatsoever with sports or wildlife or studio or flash. This means my in-camera flash never pops up and my use of AF is limited to single shot centre-point only. I always shoot raw and post process as needed.</p>

<h2>Part 1: What to Buy?</h2>

<p>Jump in now and make a purchase or wait for the next round of model upgrades? That is the perennial conundrum of the digital photographer. It arises because no manufacturer every quite addresses all our needs in one camera model, whether because the required technology hasn't come into existence or because no manufacturer is clever enough to see the <b><i>right</i></b> way to implement feature X. ;)</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>For my part, what I want is very simple ... apparently /too/ simple. I want a digital camera just like my well-brassed Nikon FM (or an Olympus OM or ...?) but with a full frame sensor (or pretty darned good smaller sensor) inside, in place of a roll film transport. End of story. What I keep getting is a choice between various plastic-fantastic abominations -- some called dSLRs and some called interchangeable lens mirrorless. I owned a Pentax K20D dSLR and an Olympus E-P1 mirrorless. Both were adequate for certain tasks but -- being strongly in the Keep It Simple, Stupid camp -- I really want to use just one camera in all situations (Keep It Simple). Switching from one interface to another interface confuses the heck out of my fingers and reflexes, which is where the Stupid part comes in. The full frame sensor would give me the image quality I want for all my pictures. The small, FM-sized body would give me the stealth and portability of a mirrorless. The big, beautiful FM optical finder would give me a comfortable view to work with. The back-to-basics selection of dials on the FM would perfectly match the limits of my limited mentality. And just by the way, I'd require a 24-70 f/4 zoom to go with.</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>But somehow no one on the island of Honshu seems to share my vision; instead, they all seem to be seduced by a different vision of what a camera should be. A vision that more closely resembles the cockpit of a jet fighter aircraft: 10,000 knobs, levers, and dials and counting. (OK: my tongue is a bit in-cheek here; I'm not really ag'in all the complexity of the interface of a pro or enthusiast dSLR, since I actually understand that most of it is set-once-and-forget.) They don't seem to get that if Leica can stick a FF sensor in a small metal body they should be able to do so too. And size /is/ important. We know that from another timeless aphorism: the best camera for the job is the one you have with you. And from it's corrolary: the smaller the camera, the more likely you are to carry it or Smaller Is Better.</p>

<p>As new model announcements came and went, each finding a new and different way to disappoint, I finally came to understand that the camera I want is not going to show up any time soon. So, when a confluence of circumstances caused me to want to replace my dSLR, I was forced to consider the market and opt for the best of a "bad" bunch. As much as I would have liked the image quality, Smaller Is Better (not to mention my bank account) ruled out an FF dSLR. As much as I would have liked the small size, the lack of image quality (not to mention the pervasively crippled interfaces) ruled out mirrorless. I was tempted by the crop of mini-dSLRs such as the Pentax K-r and the Nikon D5100, but knew I couldn't live with the dim little pentamirror finders and the lack of an adult control set. That left just one product category: the higher-end/mid-sized APS-C dSLR and included the Sony A55, Canon 60D, Pentax K-5, and Nikon D7000. The experimental pellicle finder of the A55 together with the perils of an unfamiliar lens line-up ruled out that option. My long-standing war against Canon's antediluvian control set ruled out the 60D, my recent troubles with Pentax's focusing? or IS? or lens design? made me gun-shy to risk the otherwise attractive K-5. All of which made my purchasing decision very simple: D7000 or nothing.</p>

<p>The fact that I had no less than six F mount lenses collecting dust certainly favoured that choice as well, although the fact that they all covered the full frame focal length spectrum made them of limited importance. If anything I shoot wide to normal, certainly not normal to tele, so part of the Nikon decision was still a matter of what lens or lenses to buy to cover wide angle, and after some research I decided to at least give the 18-105 kit lens a go. So, buying decision made, off the the local camera store to take the proverbial plunge.<</p>

<h2>Part 2: Evaluating my Purchase</h2>

<h3>Lenses</h3>

<p>First thing I want to say about Nikon is that the 18-105 is one incredible lens. It being a kit 3.5 to 5.6 does not lend one to confidence, but I've tested the begeezus out of it and am blown away at every turn. I have a Nikkor 35-70 f/2.8 that I was planning to use for landscape work in spite the crop factor taking away wide angle. Many regard the 35-70 as one of the very sharpest moderate lenses -- prime or zoom -- Nikon ever created; but all it gives me is maybe a one percent improvement in detail over the 18-105 across the 35-70 range, and surprisingly at least a stop less transmittance. I also have a 28mm f/2.8 AIS Nikkor prime. The 18-105 runs circles around it. Not only is the 18-105 sharp, it has virtually no corner distortion except at the widest focals, and there it's as good as anything I've seen. Plus, the combination of 18-105 on D7000 has just the right heft and perfect balance to my tastes, where the 17-70 on the K20D I formerly used was a heavy combo, over-balanced by the lens. Were Nikon ever to make an 16-45 or 18-55 or longer constant aperture pro zoom, I might consider upgrading, but right now I can't think of any lens that would tempt me to take the 18-105 off my D7000. And I can't think of anything Pentax has that I'd rather use. I continued to have doubts whether I should have risked opting for the K-5, but the 18-105 proves an unexpected argument in favour of the D7000.</p>

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Caveat</b>: One photographic clich&eacute; is to choose a camera system based on the extent of its lens selection, and Nikon has a huge selection to choose from. Only problem with that is that it's only true if you shoot 35mm or digital FF. Nikon's DX (APS-C) options are less than exhaustive, particularly at high-end wide angle. The 18-105 more than covers my current needs, but others may want to double-check before blindly assuming Nikon makes everything they need.</p>

<h3>Body</h3>

<p>Now on to the camera itself. I started off missing the Pentax interface terribly. After a week (and no thanks to the incredibly obtusely written manual) I managed to find acceptable work-arounds for the Pentax features I was so happy with. I don't have a K-5 or K-7 to compare with, but my guess is that their shutters are quieter than the D7000's even in quiet mode, which can be an important consideration.

<p class="MessageBox"><b>Oil spill</b>: As I write this, Nikon forums are a-buzz with reports of oil splattering from the mirror mechanism and onto the sensor. My D7000 had several un-ringed spots showing on a standard defocused test shot when purchased; but enabling auto dust cleaning sent them packing and into my third week of ownership no sign of oil. The oil spot reports are pretty credible, so I count myself as one of the lucky ones in not having that problem.</p>

<p>Another hot topic on Nikon forums is image softness due to mirror slap. Vibration due to mirror slap and shutter motion is indeed enough to soften the 16 MP image output of this camera; and apparently some other camera models have better damped mirrors. The D7000 is targeted at a very fast 6 frames per second. Whether that rules out better damping I don't know, but the mirror vibrations intrude even a single shot rates. I picked up a forum tip to enable custom option D11, shutter delay, and that, combined with tripod and MLU, pretty much takes softness down to AA filter + lens imperfection territory. For shooting handheld shutter speeds over 1/500th combined with VR and regular shutter release comes pretty close to killing the softness issue. Adding quiet mode or even 2 sec delay doesn't help significantly. But the combination of VR + quiet mode + D11 delay does make a big difference.</p>

<p>AF is something I'm not particularly competent to judge; all I can say is it's much snappier than what I was getting from the three year old K20D and works in every circumstance I've so far managed to throw at it. Plus, while the D7000 has a nice fine focus (back focus) tuning system, my particular unit doesn't need it with any lens I own.</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p>Fig. 5: FM controls</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>The D7000 has by my count 28 buttons, dials, and levers plus no less than 50 specific control customization options in the menu. You'd think that would be enough to cover any conceivable need. If so, you've never shot with a Pentax dSLR. It may be hopelessly old-timey but some of us greybeards like to put a camera into manual mode and set focus, shutter, aperture, and ISO as separate events. If I set focus to distance X, I want the focus to stay at distance X until I darned well feel like changing it to distance Y. Ditto for the other variables. It's really not a bad way to work, and it can actually be faster, more flexible, and more responsive than any other shooting mode once you get over the culture shock ... and assuming the camera design doesn't get in the way.</p>

<p>The D7000 has the requisite two thumb wheels for shutter and aperture. ISO requires a peculiar combination of pressing a left-hand button on the back plus twirling a thumb wheel. But of course if you're such a fuss-budget that you can't leave ISO selection to the auto-ISO feature, then tough luck, right? If you want to do the fuss-budget thing for AF, then Nikon is right there with a custom option to set the AE-L/AF-L button to AF-Hold. Only problem is that I have totally average-sized hands and the AE-L/AF-L button is just out of reach for my thumb. Now, if I could put AF-Hole on the Fn button or the DOF preview button ... but no, not in the cards. Finally, Pentax has a really sweet little green button just behind the shutter release. If does something nifty in Program mode; in Manual mode one press of the green button instantly resets my aperture to what the meter suggests. If I'm shooting a subject in direct sunlight and I have an aperture of 1/3000th, and then my subject slips into a shadow area so I need an aperture of 1/30th, no frantically thumbing the aperture wheel through thirteen or more clicks. Just press the green button once and you're laughing.</p>

<p>(In case you're wondering; the work-around I've settled on is fine, now that I'm used to it. I now work in aperture priority with spot metering on, compensation set to +2, AE-L on the Fn button, and AF-L on the shutter half-press.)</p>

<p>On the plus side, there are some interface decisions on the D7000 that I really like. Mirror lock-up is a two click process. If you move the mode dial to MLU, you're not simply blacked out in the finder. Instead, you can compose off the mirror as usual, then when you're ready to shoot you press the shutter release once to up the mirror, then a second time to take the shot. Tres nice. Deleting the current shot isn't a laborious process of pressing the trash button then the up arrow then the OK button. Two trash button presses and you're done. Bracketing doesn't require digging into menus to modify or to enable. Press the BKT button then thumb one thumb wheel to set the number of shots in the sequence, press the other to set the stop interval between them, and go. You can even fire each shot separately by choosing single shot instead of continuous.</p>

<p>Other things I like include the ease of saving all current settings as a U1 or U2 custom shooting mode. (Downside is that /all/ settings are included and I really don't want my ISO jumping from 3200 to 100 or some such whenever I want to invoke a custom mode.) Saving one's most frequently used menu options is handy, being able to scroll through the most recently used options is gravy.</p>

<h3>Image Stabilization</h3>

<p>I long resisted lens-based IS on the theoretical ground that only those lenses so equipped would have that feature. In practice, on Pentax dSLRs at least, it takes about a full second for IS to kick in for each and every shot. Press the shutter before IS is fully up to speed and you get a peculiar partial-frame blur. In theory, you need to wait for lens-based IS to kick in as well, but in practice it seems instantaneous to me.</p>

<h3>Image Quality 1: Resolution</h3>

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>OK: I've got this nifty 16.2 megapixel sensor, so how does it perform? As mentioned, you need to jump through so many hoops to keep from losing half those megapixels to vibration blur and you need such a good lens set to a small enough aperture, that the step up in resolution from the more common 12 MP sensor is not something most of us are not going to see all that often.</p>

<h3>Image Quality 2: Dynamic Range and High ISO Noise</h3>

<p>The following dynamic range test shots were taken in raw, the developed in Lightroom with fill light at max and chroma noise reduction at max, then opened in Photoshop where I applied a very strong curve to open the shadows. I spot-metered to place the brightest part of the scene just shy of over-exposure. If you've ever taken a window shot like this that preserves highlights you know that everything surrounding the window is either ink-black or nearly ink-black, hence the huge boost to the shadow areas in post processing. It's not that we would do this in "real life"; it's just a ploy to let us see clearly the relative noise levels in the deepest shadows, and hence make a call at DR. I've marked exposure values (EVs) at various points:</p>

<p></p> Fig 6. 1600 crops

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>The increase in dynamic range is real enough. DR is hard to quantify because how much latitude a camera has at the shadow end depends on how much noise degradation you're willing to tolerate. For me, the D7000 has 10 usable stops DR at base ISO, up from 8.5 for my previous K20D. Corrolary to DR is high ISO performance. Reading the hype I was expecting almost D700 or D3 cleanness, but in reality I'm seeing a relatively modest 1-stop improvement over the previous generation of APS-C sensors. More important to me is the great improvement in pattern noise from the hideous banding I was getting from my Pentax.</p>

<h3>Image Quality 3: Colour Depth and Accuracy</h3>

<div class="div_pic_no_click">

<img src="" width="" height="" alt="No larger version" />

<p></p> Fig. 7: posterization at high ISOs

</div> <!--div_pic_no_click-->

<p>Last but not least, colour depth. Because our monitors are typically 8-bit sRGB devices and the dithering pattern of even the best inkjet printers hardly exceeds 8-bits of subtlety, whether or cameras are 12-bit or 14-bit colour devices is something more obvious on a spec sheet than in daily experience. Where it does come visibly into play is when we start tossing away bit depth by upping the ISO level. Just as the D7000 gives me a stop more DR at any given ISO than my previous dSLR, so it also gives me a stop better colour response at each ISO. This after all is implicit in the DR and ISO numbers. You get better DR at least in part when you have a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), The less noise you have at a given signal boost (ISO increment) the higher you can go in ISO settings before you may as well not bother. The few pixels that are wiped out by noise at any given ISO setting, the more pixels that are actually doing their job of reporting scene colour.</p>

<p>Less obviously, we think of base ISO as being a totally clean signal, but that's far from the case. There is noise in any base ISO image even in the brightest areas; the darker you go into the shadows the fewer the photons being collected and the more obvious the system noise becomes. So there are real differences between cameras even at base ISO, it's just that it's so easy for software noise reduction to handle the noise that's there that we don't realize there ever was any noise to begin with. We may never see it, but it does affect the colour depth and therefore the colour gradation capability of a camera's output at base ISO. And again, that one-stop improvement of the D7000 over the last generation, shows up at base ISO as well as in lower light.</p>

<p>Another colour consideration is accuracy. I use the latest Lightroom to develop my raws, and I'm blown away by the default camera profile for the D7000. I did my own (single luminant) profile and can't see any difference by swapping between the two. I shoot raw instead of JPEG, but comparing the D7000's side-car JPEGs with Lightroom conversion in linear, all I had to do was drop the JPEG contrast parameter to minimum and leave saturation at the default to get very much that same colour handling. Very nice.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p>While there is no carbon fibre camera on earth that will ever come within a country mile of matching a well-brassed Nikon FM in eye or hand appeal, the D7000 comes as close as such a thing is going to come to being an object that I actually want to handle. Plasticky or not, it has more than a little of that aura of precision engineering that makes a Lexus outclass a Lada -- not just in build but in responsiveness. But I assume those things would be true for the K-5 too. My over-riding concerns were with size/weight and image quality. Yes: the D7000 dwarfs the FM, but surprisingly the combination of D7000 + 18-105 weighs almost exactly 2 lbs and the combination of FM + 35-70 also weighs 2 lbs. In both cases 2 lbs in a holster bag is a kit I can carry around all day long without noticing its presence. But with the FM, I'd occasionally need to swap out to the 28 prime for extra wide angle and so would have to carry and fuss with that second lens. The real downside of the sheeer size of the D7000 boils down to the intimidation factor when doing un-posed people shots, especially street. Thus I still need to go out the door with a mirrorless or compact when people photography is on the agenda.</p>
