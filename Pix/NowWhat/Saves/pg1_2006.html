<p class=SimpleBrownBoxSmall>This portfolio is by way of a visual diary. These are my latest pictures that show any promise of being keepers. I'll be adding new pictures as I make them; and removing older pictures as they either get included in permanent portfolios or relegated to the trash.

<p>I can still hardly believe this one. Taken handheld at twilight just outside my workplace in downtown Toronto, it's 1/6th second at 200 ISO, yet tack sharp. Combination of image stabilization and a great deal of dumb luck. I love the ghostly black blurs of fellow pedestrians:

<h2>October 2006</h2>

<p>Dawn along the Lake Ontario waterfront. These three are from the only fall landscape outing I did this year. In years past I must have been pretty lucky to get some decent shooting weather at the peak of fall colour. But this year and last, no such luck. Nevertheless, I actually prefer the forlorn colours when red and yellow are turning to orange and brown:

<p class=SmallNoteCentered>06-L5028</a>

<p>06-L5028 is an image I keep coming back to - I'm currently on the 7th edit and it has no less than 10 painstaking selections saved as channels. I think I've <b>finally</b> got it right; but only time will tell. The original RAW file, however, looks like this:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/P10500028sz500x281.jpg" width=500 height=281 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>06-L5028 original shot

<p>Please do not be insulted, but so far I have not shown this print to a single person who has reacted with anything short of total bemusement. Apparently, a whole lot of people dozed through Art 101... 

<p>I was prowling the boardwalk of a local beach in the heat of a summer day with my trusty Panasonic LX1 pocket digital camera. Quite a distance away (even for a 4x zoom) I happened to notice a woman near the water, dressed in the sort of black head-to-toe garb I now associate with the Muslim religion, but would formerly have assumed denoted some Catholic sect. On the very off-chance that the shot would prove useful in spite of the distance, I casually pointed my camera, zoomed to max, pressed the shutter release, and moved on. This was one of several dozen shots from the same outing; yet as soon as I saw it in the raw converter, I knew I'd hit some sort of pay dirt.

<p>The first thing I need to confess is that I don't have a clue what this image "means" in the sense of translating it into some sort of cohesive verbal story. From my point of view the cluster of woman in black + child + man in bathing suit at the centre of the frame possesses some sort of archetypal significance that I cannot - and do not wish to - attempt to put into words. As a place-holder for this hidden significance I'll refer to these three people as representing some sort of contemporary rhyme on the theme of Joseph+Mary+Infant-Jesus.

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/06-L5028crop4.jpg" width=350 height=732 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Crop #1: central threesome

<p>As a visual artist, I deliberately court a bit of personal schizophrenia while working in the form of holing myself up in my visual cortex and firmly barricading the door against the verbal cortex. Acting purely as a visual/non-verbal agent I cropped the original shot, moved the gulls back into the cropped frame, removed the mid-afternoon blue cast to the colours, and increased the contrast at the shadow end to give the resulting image more grab. I then stole the little girl with her watering can from another shot taken on the same outing and in the same light and plunked her stage left into this scenario: I needed her to stand in for you and me as the spectator to this archetypal event.

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/06-L5028crop1.jpg" width=350 height=516 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Crop #2: girl with watering can

<p>The water-can girl is struck dumb with amazement. She has no more clue than we do as to what to make of the central threesome. The gulls cluster close as if sensing something important is transpiring, like angels hovering over the Christian manger. The other human figures, however, seem to me to ring the changes on the theme of humanity-as-by-stander:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/06-L5028crop2.jpg" width=350 height=511 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Crop #3: woman on left

<p>On the left is a young woman that we might glibly label as mentally challenged. If you've ever had personal dealing with her particular corner of the human condition, you'll recognize her posture and implied motion. She has experienced a bolt of intense joy, against which she has none of our crusty defenses, and is trying to digest that emotional charge by temporarily turning her back on, and moving away from, its source. A few seconds later she will turn back toward the central threesome, this time prepared to give her being up to its intensity; and in so-doing will become permanently blessed and transfigured.

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/06-L5028crop3.jpg" width=318 height=429 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Crop #4: woman in red bathing suit

<p>Proceeding to the right, the woman in the red bathing suit is the classic passer-by: enjoying herself but oblivious to the portentous event unfolding just off to her right. 

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/06-L5028crop5.jpg" width=350 height=593 BORDER=8 alt="click to enlarge">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Crop #5: figures to the right

<p>Also in the water but to the right of the central threesome are four figures: a man with a young girl on his shoulders plus twin boys in turquoise+green bathing trunks. The closer of the twins is looking directly at the girl with the watering can. He is caught in a posture of startlement that derives from his witnessing then adopting the girl's reaction to the central trinity. The other three figures behind him are parallel to the woman in the red bathing suit - they are caught up in a rapture that radiates from the central threesome, but are not themselves aware of its source.

<p>The rest of the scene is a spartan mix of beach sand, still water, and sky - none of which has enough complexity to detract from the human drama. What beach, water, and sky do <b>not</b> provide is any sort of visual safety, any form of nesting, of the figures that any bit of barrier on the left and right edges of the frame would provide. The figures in this vignette are firmly clustered about a central point, but the backdrop of beach, water, and sky sweep them back into the relentless tide of time and events.-->
