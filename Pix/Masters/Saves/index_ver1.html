<H1>Some Masterpieces from the Public Domain</H1>

<P CLASS=SmallNoteCentered>Version 1.0, &copy; 2009 by Dale Cotton, all rights reserved

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I recently had occasion to do some "formal" portraits, which is something I'd never done before or been particularly interested in. The first thing that occurred to me was to study portraits done by others, which led me to investigate the old masters. Knowing there are some fairly large image files available on-line, and especially on Wikipedia, I proceeded to root some out and download them, with the intention of printing them then living with them for a while. One thing led to another: I soon found myself investigating what's available from the complete repertoire of several Baroque and Rococo masters, not just their portraits.

<p>However, I quickly discovered that the vast majority of the available image files are obviously decade-old film scans done with primitive equipment and no semblance of a modern colour-profiled and calibrated workflow. Consider this scan of Vermeer's The Art (or Allegory) of Painting:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_011-sz500x584.jpg" width=500 height=584 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 1: Jan Vermeer van Delft: The Art of Paining, c. 1666

<p>It's disfigured by a magenta cast as blatant as a plutocrat's limo, yet no attempt was made to correct it. A simple Levels adjustment to the green channel would have done wonders.

<p>Or consider this scan of Vermeer's Woman in Blue Reading a Letter:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_012-sz400x500.jpg" width=400 height=500 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 2: Jan Vermeer van Delft: Woman in Blue Reading a Letter, c. 1664 (version 1)

<p>Very pretty, but would Vermeer really have painted a jaundiced model? If we look for another version of the same picture on-line, we come up with this:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/Vermeer_Woman_in_Blue_Reading_Letter_sz400x500.jpg" width=400 height=500 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 3: Jan Vermeer van Delft: Woman in Blue Reading a Letter, c. 1664 (version 2)

<p>These colours are closer to being believable but now there's a blue cast in evidence. In contrast, the picture of Diana Leaving her Bath by Boucher, which you can see below (nudity warning), was taken with a digital camera (Nikon D50 is in the meta-data), and the increase in quality and palpable accuracy is mind-boggling. Until we have similar re-takes of all the public domain masterpieces on-line, the best we can do is make an educated guess in each case.

<p>But colour is far from the only serious issue affecting these older scans. Consider this unreduced segment from the largest scan available of Rembrandt's The Night Watch:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/Night_Watch_crop-sz550x550.jpg" width=550 height=550 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 4: Rembrandt van Rijn: The Night Watch, 1642

<p>What looks to be blue rain streaking down is apparently some sort of damage to the actual painting. While the horizontal streaks seem to be a combination of scanner stutter and a serious scratch running across quite a bit of the width of the canvas. There is also the inevitable crackling of linseed oil drying over centuries, as in:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/Girl_with_Pearl_Earring_crop-sz590x580.jpg" width=590 height=500 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 5: Jan Vermeer van Delft: Girl with Pearl Earring, 1665

<p>But how obnoxious this crackling is depends entirely on how the painting is lit for the camera. Here we have side lighting that casts a black shadow into every crack, making each crack maximally apparent. Notice also the white specks in the black background, which are some combination of dust on the film and glints off the sheen of the painting's surface.

<p>Once I got started exploring this problematic trove of public domain reproductions of the masters, I quickly became involved in exploring and turning up what for me are new gems. I never gave Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher (pronounced fran-swah boo-shay, no accented syllables) a moment's thought ere now. Through most of my life his superficial sensuality would have been off-putting; now I'm easily vanquished the charms of his decadent delights, however cynical must surely have been his exploitations. And reading up on Boucher in Wikipedia leads me straight to this absolutely incredible portrait:

<p style="text-align:center"><IMG SRC="Small/Boucher_par_Gustav_Lundberg_1741-sz410x539.jpg" width=410 height=539 BORDER=4 alt="image">
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 6: Gustav Lundberg: Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher, 1741

<p>Nothing could be more opposite the stilted stiffness of 99% of all posed portraits ever painted or photographed. Exactly what I was looking for!

<p class=SimpleBrownBox ><b>Warning</b>: I never expected to post any images of unclothed people on this site, any more than I would hang them in my living room, but I find M. Boucher's artistry to be so infernally exquisite I simply can't stand not to share. The fact that these are all pictures that hang in public display in the Louvre and similar galleries will have to stand in my defense. In any case, Boucher's exposures are fairly tasteful. If you prefer to give such things a miss, simply don't venture to the very bottom of this page.

<h2>Collection</h2>

<p>I'm far from done with this project, but I already have more than enough to share. The following are ten JPEGs, each of a famous painting. All of these are edits based on images you can download yourself by plugging the painter and painting name into Google. Most are from the Wikipedia Commons. I've added details like physical dimension and location of the original in the meta-data of each image &ndash; something strangely lacking in Wikipedia.

<p>Clicking on any image below will open a full-size JPEG, between 1 and 3 megabytes, saved in Photoshop with very minimal compression (level 10 or level 11). You can print these at the size each image defaults to, which fits on a 13 x 19" sheet of paper, cut down to 13 x 15; or you can change to PPI number to fit the image on to the common 8.5 x 11" paper size.

<p>Again, in most of these reproductions I have no way of guaranteeing colour accuracy; all I can say is that the colours seem to me more realistic and more likely to be accurate than the original scans I had to work with. I've minimized scanner defects such as dust spots, false colour lines, and streaking, to the extent possible without radically altering the image. I've reduced paint crackling and environmental damage as captured by the reproductions without trying to wish it away. (Technical note: for the benefit of those with unprofiled printers, I've used the small-gamut sRGB colour space for these pictures. I think it unlikely that any oil painted pigment can exceed its confines.)

<p>In short, I'm a working artist and these are the same files I've printed for my own study. I offer them to you for whatever they may be worth.

<h2>Vermeer</h2>

<p>Prior to this exercise I simply enjoyed basking in Vermeer's light. Living with good reproductions for a few days has been a bit of an eye-opener. I find Jan's draftsmanship, however accurate, to be a bit graceless. Where he excels is in rendering the subtle quality of illumination. 

<p>Each time I witness an exhibit of amateur oil paintings I'm reminded anew just how difficult a medium this is to control. The trick is to make the paints do your bidding, not vice versa; few artists reach that level, and fewer still soar above the inherent difficulties. The debate continues whether Vermeer used a camera obscura. My instinct is that he did; simply because his paintings show us the true genius of colour photography: capturing the subtle and evanescent beauty of the world that rarely holds still long enough to capture in paint.

<p>Not just Vermeer, but the whole "school" of 17th century bourgeois Dutch painting of which he was a part, is also valuable to photographers in reminding us that great images can spring from humble subject matter. 

<p>In struggling with Woman in Blue, figures 2 and 3 above show my quandary. Here is the compromise I've settled on; my best guess as to what the actual colours must be. This interpretation is not only heavily influenced by Fig. 3, it also looks to Fig. 9 and other Vermeers, so many of which depict the same room in his home in which Woman in Blue is reading:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft-Woman_in_Blue_Reading_a_Letter-c1664-012-edited_DC_lvl10.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft-Woman_in_Blue_Reading_a_Letter-c1664-012-sz500x614.jpg" width=500 height=614 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 7: Jan Vermeer van Delft: Woman in Blue Reading a Letter, c. 1664

<p>I had a similar conflict with the pallet of this image, since there is both a warm+over-saturated and a cool-hued version of this image on line:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft-Girl_with_Pearl_Earring-1665-edited_DC_lvl11.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft-Girl_with_Pearl_Earring-1665-sz500x603.jpg" width=500 height=603 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 8: Jan Vermeer van Delft: Girl with Pearl Earring, 1665

<p>The original scan file from which I worked for The Art of Painting is much more authoritative, so there was little to argue with regarding colours. Other problems, but not colour:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft-The_Art_of_Painting-c1666-011-edited_DC_lvl10.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft-The_Art_of_Painting-c1666-011-sz500x585.jpg" width=500 height=585 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 9: Jan Vermeer van Delft: The Art of Painting, c. 1666

<h2>Rembrandt</h2>

<p>I didn't have any particular attachment to Rembrandt's output until I started doing my own indoor nighttime candids. Rembrandt's dark backgrounds and yellow lighting now tell me what should have been obvious: that he painted what he saw indoors, and often by candle or lamp light. He must have bought sepia and ochre by the truck load.

<p style="text-align:center"><a href=Full/"Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn-Portrait_of_Saskia_as_Flora-1635-086-edited_DC_lvl10.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn-Portrait_of_Saskia_as_Flora-1635-086-sz500x638.jpg" width=500 height=638 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 10: Rembrandt van Rijn: Portrait of Saskia as Flora, 1635

<p>The next painting is apparently the basis for an entire motion picture now in production. Here we have a very large scan file to work from with the colours distorted by a simple green cast. More problematic is that the sky and shadows are blacked out. Superficially, this blackness seems appropriate, especially given the common title, The Night Watch. But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch">Wikipedia</a> tells us the idea this is a night picture is a mistake:

<p class=Quotebox>For much of its existence, the painting was coated with a dark varnish which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene, leading to the name by which it is now commonly known. This varnish was removed only in the 1940s.

<p>There is much more to the arch than I was able to recover. 
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Rembrandt_Night_Watch_1642.jpg

<p>The strangest element of this picture for me is what I immediately took to be the appearance of Saskia (Rembrandt's wife). You can read Wikipedia's explanation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Watch_(painting)">here<a>. If this is indeed Saskia and she is indeed supposed to be a child, as her relative height suggests, what's jarring is the relatively adult proportions of head to body height. 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn-The_Night_Watch-1642-De_N8W8-edited_DC_lvl10.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn-The_Night_Watch-1642-De_N8W8-sz600x502.jpg" width=600 height=502 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 12: Rembrandt van Rijn: The Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, known as the 'Night Watch', 1642

<p>Rembrandt is often called the master of brush work, and looking at this self portrait at full scale makes it immediately clear why. His fluid, confident lines are just the opposite of Vermeer's. 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn-Self_Portrait-1660-222256-edited_DC_lvl11.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn-Self_Portrait-1660-222256-sz500x593.jpg" width=500 height=593 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 11: Rembrandt van Rijn: Self-Portrait (with Black Beret), 1660

<h2>Boucher</h2>

<p>I've already had a bit to say about Fran&ccedil;ois. His cheerful pallet and classical-mythology-inspired themes, contrast dramatically with Rembrandt's heavy darknesses and biblical stories. 

<p>Boucher's Venus, as well as her companions, in Fig. 14 has such an exquisitely sweet face that it's almost as though he had children pose as models for the faces, then adults pose for the bodies. We also have to note, since it's hardly avoidable, that Boucher's idea of the human female breast (with which he must have been intimately acquainted) is both modest and almost sexless. But more than that, it's decidedly peculiar, given their defiance of the law of gravity. 

<p>In fact, Boucher's nudes are very much opposite the erotic, being rather idealizations in the Graeco-Roman tradition. These are goddesses, not in the sense of beings with super powers, but in the sense of beings we might put on a pedestal and adore. And as soon as the word "adore" comes to mind, something clicks for me: perhaps the closest parallel to the sweetness of Boucher's females is Michelangelo's Mary in his Pieta. Boucher was very much a product of the sheltered world of the classical French court (Louis XV). This was an island of liberation within a vast sea of repressive/conservative Cahtolicism. I can imagine him very consciously deciding that if painters were going to defy the status quo by unclothing the human form, it was imperative in doing so that they remain beyond any reproach of mere carnality. 

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Francois_Boucher-Triumph_of_Venus-1740-031-edited_DC_LVL11.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Francois_Boucher-Triumph_of_Venus-1740-031-sz500x557.jpg" width=500 height=557 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 14: Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher: The Triumph of Venus, 1740

<p>Next is the sole painting in this set captured with a digital camera and clearly processed with considerable care for colour accuracy. If we didn't have this reproduction we'd be forced to live with something as depressing as <a href="http://www.museumsyndicate.com/item.php?item=6585">this</a>. Notice that Boucher has not just given us a pretty girl in the goddess Diana (figure on right) and her inseparable companion, Callisto. More than that he's captured that indefinable vacuity of expression we associate with extreme youth (again, I see children posing for their faces); and that, combined with a genuine sweetness of character, belies the callous butchery implicit in her clutch of fresh corpses, bottom right. 

<p>Notice also the almost comic relief of the hunting dogs, juxtaposed in darker hues beside the delicate and bright pastels of the divines. The dogs and game corpses bracket the divines, as if to accentuate their etherealness. Boucher's flesh tones here are a rare treat in combining pastel pink and pastel amber to create a luminosity with no hint of deadness, and most of all no hint of the jaundiced ochre we so commonly see used for Caucasian flesh tones. Behold also the blue-green hues Boucher has used for the background trees. This is a colour we might expect for vegetation obscured by great distance. Wikipedia tells us "Boucher is famous for saying that the natural world was 'trop verte et mal eclaire' (too green and badly lit)". Truly, a fellow spirit &ndash; I've long been on record railing against what I call the green plague of summer (not to mention the white plague of winter). ;)

<p>But most of all, pipe how absurdly small Diana's feet are in proportion to her body (Callisto's gaze bizarrely brings it to our attention). In other paintings Boucher has the head nearly as small as the feet. This was surely felt to flatter the subject by the standards of the day.

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Francois_Boucher-Diane_sortant_du_bain-1742-2712-edited_DC_lvl10.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Francois_Boucher-Diane_Sortant_du_Bain-1742-2712-sz600x487.jpg" width=600 height=487 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 15: Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher: Diana Leaving the Bath, 1742

<p>In the next image, we see almost every element in the picture has been personified. As we've already seen, if your name is Boucher (which grotesquely is the French word for butcher), any excuse to introduce an unclothed or scantily clothed human figure is a good excuse. ;) Rising sun? Surely a shapely young man. Morning star? Surely a shapely young woman.

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Francois_Boucher-The_Rising_of_the_Sun-1753-027-edited_DC_LVL11.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Francois_Boucher-The_Rising_of_the_Sun-1753-027-sz500x592.jpg" width=500 height=582 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 16: Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher: The Rising of the Sun, 1753.

<h2>Rubens</h2>

<p>There's a lot more of Ruben's huge output available on the web. This is the only one I've done so far. The scan file here seems pretty believable, so I didn't adjust the colours:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="Full/Peter_Paul_Rubens-Landscape_with_Thunderstorm-1630-057-edited_DC_lvl11.jpg"><IMG SRC="Small/Peter_Paul_Rubens-Landscape_with_Thunderstorm-1630-057-600x423.jpg" width=600 height=423 BORDER=8 alt="image"></a>
<p class=SmallNoteCentered>Fig. 13: Peter Paul Rubens: Landscape with a Thunderstorm, Philemon, and Baucis, c. 1630
