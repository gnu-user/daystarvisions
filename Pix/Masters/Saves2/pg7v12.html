<h3>Albrecht Altdorfer</h3>

<p>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Altdorfer">Albrecht Altdorfer</a></p>

<p>Albrecht Altdorfer lived from 1480 to 1538 in southern Germany. I've toned down the obviously false super-saturation of the Wikipedia Commons image file as much as I dared. This version is at least within the realm of possibility as to what oil-based pigments can do; but I'm certainly no historian so can't say how appropriate it is to the period:

<h3>Leonardo da Vinci</h3>

<p>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a></p>

<p>Leonardo lived in Italy from 1452 to 1519; more than that it would be pointless repeat, given his fame. 

<p>There are excellent scans available on the above Wikipedia page of some of his most famous images, including The Last Supper and Mona Lisa. Fig. 8-2 shows us the Mona Lisa as it currently exists. Whatever else history may say about the model Leonard posed for this painting, there is no indication she had advanced jaundice: that affliction is due to 500 years of linseed oil yellowing and who knows what pigment changes:

<p>Fig. 8-2a: Mona Lisa (La Gioconda), Leonardo da Vinci, 1503-1505 (current colours))</p> 
 
</div> <!--div_pic_click--> 

<p>Click on Fig. 8-2a to go to the Wikipedia page; there you'll find the full scan file plus two attempts to derive the original colours by removing the yellowing. The one labeled Restoration version 2 has excellent skin tone; but why the aqua and green background?

<p>Fig. 8-2b: Current Mona Lisa with age-yellowing corrected for by Liberal Freemason</p> 
 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click--> 

<p>It's not because that's what happens when you neutralize the severe yellow cast. Here's a rough idea of what that looks like:

<div class="div_pic_no_click"> 
 
<img src="Small/Mona_Lisa-remove_yellow-sz330x500.jpg" width="330" height="500" alt="No larger version" /> 
 
<p>Fig. 8-2c: Current Mona Lisa with only age-yellowing removed</p> 
 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click--> 

<p>I'm sure we've all seen a green sky at least once in our lives around sunset, so it's not inconceivable. The main problem I see with green, as in Fig. 8-2b, is that the vast majority of paintings from the Renaissance and later by da Vinci and other masters stick to blue as the counterpoint to flesh tones, so there's no particular reason to suppose da Vinci would have opted for green in this one case. Yet another problem is that the water in the landscape on the left is blue. We naively think of water as being blue, but of course water is like a mirror and is only blue when the sky is blue. More likely, to my mind, is that da Vinci opted for a blue sky but the pigment he used was discoloured over time by chemical interactions, possibly due to something in the cottonwood panel on which this picture was painted. Why didn't the blue pigment in the water also discolour? The only explanation I can think of is due to the sky being a much lighter blue than the water. A lighter blue would mean less blue pigment plus the addition of white pigment, either or both of which could be the culprit (if there is one).

<a href="Full/Mona_Lisa-Leonardo_Da_Vinci-1503-1505-DCedit.jpg"><img src="Small/Mona_Lisa-DCedit-sz463x700.jpg" width="463" height="700" alt="click for larger image" /></a>
 
<p>Fig. 8-3: Mona Lisa (La Gioconda), Leonardo da Vinci, 1503-1505 (restored)</p> 
 
</div> <!--div_pic_click--> 

<p>Fig. 8-3 is my own colour restoration. Understand that these colours are sheer guesswork on my part. (Even if you buy into my blue sky theory, do I have the right shade of blue?) If they please you, fine; otherwise, the safe option is to live with the original/yellowed version. All I can tell you is that I've tried every variation on the background and sky from sunset reds to overcast grey; and the above &ndash; as radical as it seems at first blush &ndash; is the only thing that seems to work.

<p>The other great mystery about this painting is of course the smile. You can believe whatever theories about the model being pregnant and/or Leonardo's mistress you like. The reality, however, is that posing for a painted portrait is nothing like posing for a photograph. This painting almost certainly took hundreds of hours over two years to complete. Leonard would likely have sketched in the outline very quickly at the beginning then referred to the model for colour and tone values thenceforth, feeling free to modify the outline as he went along. Through all that he may well have had a real smile from the model to work from for a few minutes. My own suspicion is that he worked from the naturally expressionless face any model presents when sitting for hours. Wanting a smile, he manufactured it by up-turning both the corners of the mouth and, more interestingly, of the eyes. The wing-like, up-turned shadows on the outside edge of each eye are a configuration I personally have never seen and do not find convincing, but it certainly adds to the overall impression of enigma. And what about those plucked eyebrows? A fashion fad even then? 

<p>I almost hesitate to point this out, lest it ruin the picture for you: but the hands are 'way too big for the head &ndash; unless we're dealing with some super wide angle lens smuggled back via time machine to 1500 AD. Come to think of it: that would explain more than a few things about Leonardo, now wouldn't it? Otherwise, this hand/face size discrepancy blows the camera obscura myth right out of the water, at least for this painting.

<h3>Bernardino Luini</h3>

<p>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_Luini">Bernardino Luini</a></p>

<p>Wikipedia tells us Luini lived from appprox. 1480 to 1532 in northern Italy and was a student of Michelangelo. Historians seem to be in uncertain whether this painting was intended to represent the Old Testament Susanna or the New Testament Maria Magdalena. Either way it's a honey of a picture:</p>

<h3>Michelangelo Caravaggio</h3>

<p> Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a>

<p>In Caravaggio, a century after Altdorfer, we can see the astounding difference in realism that had grown in Europe. Caravaggio's two paintings below could easily be mistaken for photographs, and his choreography would due credit to a modern cinema director's.</p>

<div class="div_pic_click">

<h3>Peter Paul Rubens</h3>

<p> Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubens">Rubens</a></p>

<p>There's a lot more of Ruben's huge output available on the web. This is the only one I've done so far. The scan file here seems pretty believable, so I didn't adjust the colours. I can't explain either the vertical or horizontal dark streaks in the sky, but they seem to be in the painting itself, so I left them alone.</p>

<p>The patchwork of little cameos scattered throughout this (very large) canvas, such as the cattle trapped over the falls, and the group of people on the right, is reminiscent of Breugel. To me this suggests Rubens was attempting to entertain his viewers in much the same way a wandering story-teller might dramatize a familiar tale for alms. This is the same approach to visual story-telling we'd see in a Biblically-themed canvas, but here done secularly, and therefore with no attempt at solemnity.</p>

<p>But what strikes me most about this picture is how strongly the colours and almost sketchy brushwork echo the Cezannes that were to follow. This is probably more an artifact of the reproduction than the painting itself, but since I haven't seen the painting in person, I can't rightly say.</p>

<h3>Francisco Collantes</h3>

<p>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Collantes">Francisco Collantes</a></p>

<p>Apparently little is know of Francisco Collantes, except that he lived from 1599 to 1656 in Spain. We have a superb image file from the Wikipedia Commons to work with, and that combined with Francisco's skill makes for a superb reproduction:</p>

</div> <!--div_pic_click--> 

<p>Given the presence of so many saints and halos, I'm compelled to confess a sin. The <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Collantes,_Francisco_-_St_Onuphrius_-_17th_c.jpg">original</a> of this image file is peppered with dozens of watermarks reading Museo Nacionale del Prado. Wikipedia seems to be careful with its copyrights, so presumably this reproduction really is in the public domain; but if they have it wrong, so did I in removing them.</p>

<h3>Wybrand de Geest</h3>

<p>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wybrand_de_Geest">Wybrand de Geest</a>

<p>De Geest lived from 1592 to 1661 in Holland, a contemporary of Rembrandt's and married to Rembrandt's sister-in-law. As with St. Onuphrius, the beauty of this painting definitely does <i>not</i> emanate from the beauty of its subject. I marvel that His Worship permitted De Geest to paint with such relentless realism...</p>

<h3>Willem van de Velde</h3>

<p>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_van_de_Velde_the_Elder">Willem van de Velde</a></p>

<p>Willem (the Elder) lived from 1611 to 1693, moving from Holland to England toward the end of his life. Wikipedia tells us "He was the official artist of the Dutch fleet for a period"; what's obvious from the following painting is how perfectly his encyclopedic knowledge of naval craft is married to an equally awesome skill as draftsman. The reproduction we have is exceptionally large and has the unfortunate duty to reflect in excruciating detail the degree of damage this picture acquired over the centuries, which you can see by downloading the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dutch_battleships.jpg">original</a>.</p>

<p>The technique, called grisaille, is new to me, but apparently refers to painting on canvas in monochrome or very limited palatte rather than full colour. It took me dozens of hours to repair the original image file. At first I was convinced the painting was done on parchment or leather, but after a few days it became clear that the crack-and-groove texture was due to the condition of the undercoat or overcoat of glaze; the weave of the canvas does show through in various places. Here are two versions of the picture. The first is from an intermediate stage in my restoration with only actual damage removed; print this one if you prefer a stronger reminder of the passage of time:</p>

<div class="div_pic_click"> 
 
<a href="Full/Dutch_battleships-Willem_van_de_Velde_I-1672-DCedit2-reduce_cracking.jpg"><img src="Small/Dutch_battleships-Willem_van_de_Velde_I-1672-DCedit1-sz600x330.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="Fig. 8-10" /></a>

</div> <!--div_pic_click--> 

<p>The second reduces the maze of cracking, warping, and discolouration to arrive at something I hope is much closer to what the artist would have seen upon finishing his epic labour:</p>

<div class="div_pic_click"> 
 
<a href="Full/Dutch_battleships-Willem_van_de_Velde_I-1672-DCedit-major_damage_removed.jpg"><img src="Small/Dutch_battleships-Willem_van_de_Velde_I-1672-DCedit2-sz600x330.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="Fig. 8-11" /></a>
 
<p>Fig. 8-11: Dutch Flagships at Sea in a Moderate Breeze under Easy Sail, Willem van de Velde, 1672 (extensive restoration)</p> 
 
</div> <!--div_pic_click--> 

<p>The original is some 44 by 80 inches; and the image file fully repays perusing at even 200% mag. Every one of the cast of thousands has a distinct face; and several of the ships, detailed right down to the nail heads, have been identified from other records. I personally printed this on matte paper at 16 by 33 inches: roughly the maximum size possible from my printer.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, this small detail from the right of Fig. 8-11, which incidentally you're seeing here at roughly the same scale as the original:

<div class="div_pic_no_click">

<p>Fig. 8-12: Detail from Fig. 8-11</p> 
 
</div> <!--div_pic_no_click--> 

<p>I had no idea Dutch battleships were so ornately decorated. At the rate all wooden vessels went down, whether from storm or from battle, investing so much effort and expense seems almost madness. Nor did I realize such ships had stern hatches. What are the two sailors in the two open hatches doing? Bailing water? The entire image is chock-full of such fascinating vignettes.</p>

<h3>Willem van de Velde II</h3>

<p>Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_van_de_Velde_the_Younger">Willem van de Velde II</a></p>

<p>Son of the previous painter, Willem II lived from 1633 to 1707, again first in Holland, then England. Based on these two exquisite canvases from his last year, history has served him very poorly indeed. To my eye, Willem II is a true heir not just to the nautical knowledge of his father but to the masterful brushwork of Rembrandt &ndash; which is high praise indeed considering the prices Rembrandts fetch:</p>
