<p>Thanks to all the benefits of modern civilization, the average person will live about 70 years or 2,209,032,000 seconds. About 2/3s of these are committed to sleeping, eating, and bread-winning. We have found various uses for the remaining 736,344,000 seconds, of which channel surfing remains by far the most popular. But, if you should ever burn out on re-runs, sitcoms, and reality shows, consider doing art. Lack talent? Not a problem: take up photography - no drawing or painting skills required. Lack imagination? Not a problem: let Mother Nature be your guide.

<p>The more I make pictures the clearer I get about what's going on. I was just sitting on my deck - almost overcast evening sky, green plague trees receding into the distance. A small dark bird came darting into the scene, drilling a hole into the sky, then disappearing over the horizon. I'm part bird myself; my heart went out to the little guy, busy on some mission that consumed his soul. Love is the bridge that binds us to the higher plane we yearn for. 

<br><br>For, as a lens is to a camera, so a photographer is to the world. The artist participates in - not witnesses - the creation of the scene she or he renders. Where there is love to bridge the gap between artist and subject, there is always the possibility of the resulting image arcing that second gap between artist and viewer. The viewer knows love, the artist knows love, the only question is: can the artist trigger the love response in the viewer for the subject of the image? All our efforts and artifices are directed toward this end.

<p>I recently saw the following quote in an art store:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="navy">"Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- L. Da Vinci</font>

<br><br>This sums up most everything I know about art. If I had come across this quote a few years ago I would have agreed with it then too. But there are levels of agreement. It is easy to agree with Sherman that "war is hell", but I assume these words take on a whole new level of meaning for someone who has actually been on the receiving end of a bombardment. Similarly, after you've painted your first 100 pictures or made your first 1000 photographs, you will see that some thrive while others wilt on the vine. If you look for the common element in the ones that thrive you begin to latch on to the essence of the above quote as if seeing a vague shape looming in a fog that gradually clarifies as you move closer to it. 

<br><br>Surely art could be taught with a graduated series of koans like the above. "OK: you understand what Picasso meant when he said that 'to paint from nature is to draw toenails'. Good: next work on what Robert Capa meant when he said 'if your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough.'"

<p>A millionaire left his painting collection to be divided between his five nephews and neices. The collection consisted of a Monet, a Constable, a Van Gogh, a Picasso, and a Dimmerbriewski. First choice went to the eldest nephew, an avid amateur photographer. 

<br><br>The photographer locked himself into a room with all five paintings, then carefully counted the brush strokes per square inch in each one. Re-appearing after more than an hour, he smugly announced that he had decided upon the painting that had by far the highest resolution - and no amount of arguing, begging, pleading, or cajoling could possibly move him to give up his Dimmerbriewski.

<p>The more I learn about photography the more amazed I become at what a vast continent of different subject matter, equipment, approaches, techniques, passions, heroes, and much more it encompasses. The continent could in fact be the storied Africa of a few hundred years ago - easy to travel no farther than across the next river to find oneself in the territory of a completely alien tribe, speaking an incomprehensible language or dialect. Universal concepts like optics and exposure allow just enough communication between tribes to generate endless misunderstandings, which in turn generate the copious amounts of heat that give it the reputation for being such a sweltering place to live.

<br><br>On the continent of Photography it takes a very few days to cross through the territory of tribes like the MacroInsectophiles to the neighbouring AvianTelephotophiles ending up at the ViewCamera Foothills, inhabited by the gently nomadic B'n'UUs. Crossing that chain, then fording the treacherous DigitalVersusFilm Rapids, might bring us to the wild hordes of Canon-worshipping, white-lensed ProPhotoJournalistici and ProSportsPhotographici, perennially waging a war of extermination against the black-barrelled Nikon Heresiacs. A treacherous journey this, with either clan spelling almost certain death to a lone traveler armed only with a single lens, manual-action Hexar.

<p><b>Jan 07: </b>I watched a bio of Louis Armstrong over the holidays. Louis did little more than teach the world how to make music. Before Louis music was a just-so-story, made in Europe by dead people. Exquisitely crafted, beautifully rendered ... with about as much vitality as a bed pan. 

<p>Photography seems to be in need of another Louis. Is there something in the Euro-Caucasian genome that prescribes this propensity for emulating zombies? I'm late to the party, but it seems to me that photography was beginning to jive a bit in the 1930s and '40s with the likes of <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/F/friedlander/friedlander_wade_wards_granddaughters_full.html">Friedlander</a> and <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/W/winogrand/winogrand_worlds_fair_full.html">Winogrand</a>. Now, with the digital camera revolution married to the Internet revolution, there is a massive upswell of amateurs who can't seem to get past the four-square prissiness of static content, squeaky-clean detail, saturated but not garish colour, and studio-perfect lighting. 

<p>Is there no one left in photography who can understand why Louis had gravel in his voice, sang syllables that couldn't be found in any dictionary, and riffed cascades of notes that perpetually played tag with the down beat? What does the visual equivalent of that look like?

<p>What I'm talking about is different from art school experimentalism and university conceptualism. Europe recognized its own musical malaise at the same time Louis was waifing it in the streets of New Orleans. But the prescription Europe came up with was to push its head-tripping to new extremes: the dodecaphonic arythmia of Berg and Schoenberg. Art and intellect make uneasy bed-fellows; the offspring are most often alienation, neurosis, and despair. Jive shows us the way &ndash; not less in touch with the life force, but more.

<p>Jan 07 (take 2): <b>FLASH!</b> <i>We interrupt the previous editorial to bring you this New Years Eve special: </i>

<p>As a rule, I don't stay up late on New Year's Eve. Last year, the idea would have been to usher in 2006. For some reason odd-numbered years sound more important than even-numbered years to me, so I wasn't expecting much good to come out of 2006. But, artistically at least, it looks to have been my most productive year yet.

<p>I have three 13x19" Itoya portfolios that hold 48 prints each. Each is filled to the brim. One goes from 2001 to 2004 and contains all my 35mm film-based pictures. So I gleaned roughly 12 keepers for each of those four years. Then I have a second portfolio that has about a dozen pictures from the year 2000, with the rest being filled with 2005. So 2005 was a good year for me. But for 2006 I have all 48 slots of the third portfolio filled and could use room for a several more. Best year yet (although over the coming years I'll probably reject a few of the 2006 pictures I currently consider to be keepers).

<!--p>Every single one of those 144 prints is the most perfect rendition of that image I know how to put on paper after 55 years of non-stop obsessive-compulsiveness in the arts. Some artists may dream of fame and fortune, of finding that rich buyer or famous gallery owner. When I was eighteen, a pianist friend used to play Chopin for me on his baby grand (Billy Borover &ndash; where are you now?). He once told me that Chopin's mistress used to literally faint with rapture when Frederic debuted his latest composition for her. That's what I'm looking for &ndash; that's what motivates me &ndash; finding that one other human being who cannot look at any of my portfolio prints without fainting from an overdose of too much beauty!

<p>Best wishes for 2007; and may you find the same if you're an artist, or the equivalent if you're not!

<p>Breaking news! Ansel Adams, the iconic American landscape photographer long believed dead, is in fact still alive and residing incognito in a safe house near Boswell, New Mexico along with Elvis Aron Presley and a mysterious figure some believe to be Jimmy Hoffa, although this has not been confirmed. We coaxed Mr. Adams out of hiding last week to get his views on digital photography in general and the recent megapixel controversy in particular:

<p>&quot;Yes, it's true. I have been actively involved in photography through the digital revolution. I started with a 2.6 megapixel Nikon D1. Then I upgraded to a Nikon D2X when that model was released &ndash; but did not find the extra megapixels to be that important. I now shoot a special edition, titanium body, 4 megapixel Olympus C-4040, rigged with a custom-made accordion lens shade and a carbon fiber Velbon tripod, specially manufactured to my own specifications. I find this lightweight combination gives me exceptional image quality in prints up to 20x30 inches; and, in any case, everyone I show my work to seems to be able to tell the difference between Half Dome and the Grand Canyon, which of course is all that really matters.

<p>&quot;Having experimented with many tools, my digital 'darkroom' now consists of the very spartan combination of QImage and an Epson 9600 printer. Of course, I experimented with Photoshop and similar software in the beginning. But if there's one lesson I've learned over the years, it's that a good photographer gets the image right in the camera. Fussing about in post-processing is strictly for losers. [Chuckles] I remember how I used to spend hours dodging and burning every print under a dim red bulb in my darkroom &ndash; how embarrassing to look back on the follies of one's youth!&quot;

<p><b>Mar 07</b> (unpublished) The picture above is innocuous. It shows a tree in a suburban front yard, wet on the southeast side from early April rain, still dry on the northwest. If I had taken this pic in the overcast light before the rains started, not just half the tree trunk but the whole rest of the frame would have been correspondingly dull and contrast-less. If I had taken this pic the next day or the day after that - given the rainy forecast - most likely the entire trunk of the tree would have been wet. 

<p>I happen to be an unabashed and unrepentant colourist. Worse - I don't do documentary photography. No better introduction to this site than to declare that I have absolutely no compunction in post-processing about pushing any pic, no matter how dry the conditions in which I exposed the frame, to find its point of maximum in-your-face vividness, both in colour and in emotion.

<p>Mar 07 - <b>Inkjet printing tip</b>: Ever have a flake come off the coating of a print leaving an unsightly white spot behind? You may have tried retouching with ballpoint, crayon, pencil, etc. and found that nothing works because nothing matches the particular sheen of the surrounding ink. 

<p>Instead open the image file for that print; crop a small portion from the image that includes where the flake is; print that on clear film, such as overhead transparency acetate, or simply print to the wrong side of a scrap piece of photo paper (the ink doesn't dry on the back). Now use a toothpick to scrape off a daub of wet ink the same colour as what the flake should be and carefully apply it to the print. Allow to dry for a few seconds. I read this years ago on a printing forum: I wish I could attribute this to the originator but can no longer remember the name.

<p>10 May 07: If there's anyone who follows this site, you know that I shot tripod landscapes with 35mm print film up until two years ago then switched to digital, handheld, and animate subject matter. Two years later, having worked my way through the infatuation stage with handheld, I've been toying with doing a certain amount of tripod landscapes again this year. Prior experience at landscapes with my 6 mp dSLR and 8 mp LX1 has been something less than an unqualified success.

<p>10 mp is the new default, so today I took a tripod to the camera shop and shot with my LX1, my 6 mp Pentax DS, and the store's Pentax K10D. I used the store's high quality Pentax zoom (16-45) for the K10D instead of the 18-55 kit lens I have for the DS. I took pictures outside of parking lot and bare-branch trees on the horizon. It's the distant bare trees that tell the resolution story for me; to my mind there are few greater resolution challenges in photography. Returning home with a card full of raw files, I fired up Lightroom and got to work. Yes: I could see improvement - maybe 20% over the LX1 and DS. If I had used a prime lens on the K10D the resolution improvement might well have hit the 30% mark.

<p>Problem is: when I compare the result to 35mm Reala scans at 4000 ppi, the Reala wins hands down. It would be really tough to say whether the Reala has any more than 10 mp res - the grain is so prominent it's hard to make a call - but what Reala does have is <b>integrity</b> - some quality that makes a highly detailed picture just <b>work</b>. And there's also the issue my good friend Craig Norris' brought to my attention about hue gradations - I suspect especially in the reddish hues - that film still beats dSLRs at. I hate shooting film and loathe scanning; but when it comes to landscapes it's either back to 35mm or pay $20,000 for an MF-DB.

<p>Anyone know a cure for roll film curl?

<p><b>16 May '07</b>: Here's a buzzword from the corporate world: <i>repurposing</i>. The banner on this page used to read <i>Existing-light art photography</i>. As you can see I've inserted a rather strategic ampersand. I do this in conjunction with bringing you new content on the Pictures page: a portfolio of paintings instead of photographs. 

<p>This site averages about 300 visits per day, virtually all of them, I'm sure, photographers, and maybe half of those could well have no interest in art whatsoever (Hey - how does this DOF stuff work, again?). Those of you who do put art and photography in the same package may well do so because you have no interest whatsoever in all that weird stuff painters do to perfectly good pieces of paper or canvas. 

<p>If so, I think you'll be missing out on something special. Anyone who gets deeply involved doing art (including art photography) may have started out with the idea that it's to be just a hobby, a pastime, then gradually gotten hooked. You realize that has happened when you find yourself searching for your own "voice", your unique contribution to the visual microcosm. Ironically, in this case the more you press, the worse the results. The intellect is not the best tool by which to achieve this goal; almost by definition finding your artistic identity is something that has to grow as an organic extension of your total being.

<p>The first thing that struck me about the art of Linda Shedlock is that she has found her own voice. The other thing that's immediately obvious is that the voice she's found is a lyrical one.

<p><b>14 Jul '07</b>: He's so far defied my efforts to get a grab-shot, but a certain chipmunk (Chip to my Dale) has been feasting on the bird seed droppings from my bird feeder of late. He crams in as much as he can hold, then dashes with cheek pouches full to unload at his larder, then dashes back for more. I mention this because I'd like to get the shot of Chip with full cheek pouches to illustrate a concept. Namely, that the real reason we humans do this weird thing we call visual art is to hoard visual beauty when it's plentiful in order to have it around to enjoy when it's scarce. &ndash; Just another symptom of our hyper-enlarged visual cortex that we homo saps could value something as inedible as visual data to such a degree. Amazing isn't it? What will Mother Nature come up with next? A species that chooses a mate based on visual attributes or purchases food based on the attractiveness of its packaging or acquires vehicles based on their styling? ... Nah. No organism could be that contra-survival...

<p><b>Op/ed for Nov '07</b>: You'll often read on forums that obsession with equipment in photography would be like painters getting together and arguing over which brand of paintbrush is superior. This sounds very deep but fails the test of history. The reason painters don't have equipment debates is because their technology came to maturity centuries ago. If we were to listen in on two rival painters arguing back in the Renaissance, however, the story would be very different.

<p>I watched a documentary on paint technology not too long ago; painters did not always have the palette of pigments available that we take for granted now. A painter that had access to something like pure ultramarine blue or vermilion when these pigments were just being perfected would have had a dramatic technical edge over the competition. The secrets of pigment and paint preparation were closely guarded and passed down from master to apprentice.

<p>The trick is to have gear that meets your goals or goals that match your gear. Choose one.

<p class=Noteboxcentered>Rule A: make your picture worthy of the Louvre.<br>
Rule B: there are no other rules.>

<p class=Quotebox><b>A (Modern) Modest Proposal</b>: Summer is winding down up here in the northern hemisphere and the good weather ball is bouncing back into the southern court. Frankly, there ought to be some way to eliminate the southern hemisphere all together and redirect enough of that sunshine up here where the majority of people actually live (or at least the ones that matter ;), so this winter nonsense can be done away with once and for all. 
<br><br>Or perhaps the southern continents can be mirror-coated and an array of satellite mirrors used to reflect the sunlight onto the northern hemisphere. Done properly, this would also solve the global warming problem, simply by leaving the net sunlight retention of the planet at a lower level than it is at present. Mirror-coating a continent may sound extravagant; but if all the aluminum used to make pop and beer cans were recycled, melted, then misted over the land, that should do the job nicely.>

<p class=Quotebox><b>Thought for the day</b>: Here in my old age it becomes increasingly clear to me that all the world's a mix of fools and knaves. Yet to try to rise above the universal mire is simply to fall into the folly of taking oneself seriously.

<br><br>If you are observing on earth as I fly by in a space ship at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you observe the length of my ship and the duration of my transit and report it to me. Both measurements will be noticeably less than the ones I make of my own ship and my own transit time. But strangely the converse is true as well. If I observe the length of your observatory and how fast your assistant's Ferrari is traveling as he drives up the mountain on his way to work, and report these numbers to you, you will say they are both too short.

<br><br>It is said that people seldom suffer fools gladly. But in my experience the converse is equally true: fools seldom suffer wise men gladly. Fools believe their folly to be wisdom and the wise man's wisdom to be folly. This leaves us in the wonderful position of always being able to convince ourselves that we ourselves are the bearers of wisdom and that those who do not agree are fools. Never fail to take comfort from this observation &ndash; it may be the only comfort the universe will ever toss your way... ;)

<p>The first requirement of art is that it pierce the heart like a stiletto. Too many photographers mistake a sharp tool for accurate aim; others believe irony, intellect, or alienation will suffice for their targets. But the measure is as simple as it is ruthless: no one may escape great art unscathed.

The woman with the white hair in this portfolio is Grandma to my son. We don't know whether she is 80 or 81 this year. Since she spent her childhood huddled in the rubble of Tokyo during the endless air raids of WWII, no records and too few relatives survived to clarify the matter. Another gift of that period is severe osteoporosis, and a fall several years ago left her permanently crippled. Her physical and mental condition is now deteriorating so rapidly, changes are sometimes noticeable even from one day to the next.<br><br>

If we were in the habit of clinging to our automobiles as desperately as we cling to our bodies, we'd all be driving thirty or forty year old vehicles, and paying endless amounts to keep them in sufficient repair to keep them on the road.

<p class=SimpleBlueBox><b>28 Dec '08</b>: New portfolio: <a href="Pix/RainRoad/index.html"><b>Rain and on the Road</b></a>. I have zero idea whether any of the images in this portfolio will prove to be keepers, but right now I'm a bit taken with them. Now that my son is old enough to drive I had the unusual privilege of being in the passenger seat with my camera as we drove to a post-Christmas party then home again. The two dozen shots included were selected from the 160 I actually took (14 were immediately eliminated due to mis-timing the windshield wiper) and form something of a visual diary of the afternoon, being in strict chronological order. These are sized at 1000 pixels width instead of 800, so if anyone has a problem viewing them, drop me a line.

<p><b>21 Dec '08: Housekeeping</b>: All my portfolios on the <a href="PixMain.html">Pictures</a> page have now been updated to the new layout. A couple temporary portfolios (Fall '07 and Spring '08) have been removed and the best of their images moved to new homes. Plus: many new pix have been added, a few old ones removed, and several have been upgraded to new interpretations. 

<p>My main complaint now is image size. Most of my pictures are rather complex/busy, but I continue having to cram them into little JPEGs that are a mere 800 pixels wide. I do this to accommodate 1024x768 screens &ndash; yet only 9% of you are still using that small size. It's hard to know which direction to go; mini-notebooks called netbooks may become increasingly common, bringing back a resurgence of small screens. 

<p>Finally, there remains the two portfolios by guest artists. I'm always trying to drum up new guest content, but so far no joy. People strangely prefer to put their pictures exclusively on their own sites, ignoring the exposure to the 300-600 visitors per day this site gets and the over 400 other sites that link to this site. Still: not a total loss: you can find the output of several such artists by clicking on the <a href="Links.html">Related sites</a> link at the bottom of this page.

I'm still waiting ... ;) This site costs me roughly $15US per month to keep on the web. Honestly, folks: I'm not hurting and I really don't want a monkey on my back, even one that claims to lay golden eggs. ;) (Besides: I thought we were off the gold standard?)

<p><b>04 Dec '08</b>: I'm in the process of revamping the design of the portfolios on the Pictures page. Most of the portfolios use an <a href="Pix/Marinas/pg1.html">all-HTML design</a> that works just fine but is very tedious on my end for making new portfolios and editing existing ones. For the past year I've been temporizing by using Lightroom to generate <a href="Pix/K20D_Spring_2008_2/index.html">Flash portfolios</a>, but these require a plug-in to view and don't share the site layout.<br><br>

The <a href="Pix/DayBeach/index.html">new design</a> uses some basic JavaScript to greatly simplify things on my end, while providing what I feel is a convenient user experience. All you need do is click anywhere within the picture you're looking at to go to the next one (or you can click on the black arrows). This is an approach that I'm seeing more and more on the Internet and is probably already second nature to many of us. All pictures in a given portfolio load at the beginning, which makes for a somewhat slow start-up, but then pictures open snappily thereafter. I'm also making some content changes at the same time to sync these on-line portfolios with the <a href="Docs/Tuts/PhotoBook/pg1.html">"real"</a> ones.

Doors Open is an annual one-weekend event that just won the City Managers Award for 2010. My job is primarily the database back-end, so I have precious little input into cosmetics, but one thing visual I do is to edit the 150 photographs provided by the buildings. This typically involves some drastic surgery in Photoshop to correct and standardize colour (it's incredible how many different shades of blue digital cameras erroneously believe the Earth's sky can be), straighten perspective, adjust brightness, find a usable 200 x 200 pixel crop, etc.<br/><br/>

Ironically, I've never understood the appeal of architecture, but if that's your bag and you can make it to Toronto for the May 29-30 weekend, this is a no-brainer.

It's become an on-line truism that the best camera is the one you have with you. What's magical is when the camera you have with you is not just there due to portability. I continue to carry the Olympus E-P1 with me everywhere and continue to delight in the results. I was lucky enough to be in the passenger seat a few days ago, driving southbound on a highway in the rain at night. Out comes the E-P1; set it to 1600 ISO and a slow shutter speed; point it out the front window; squeeze off frames whenever something catches the eye. I misdoubt there is any camera on earth that would have given better results in this situation, no matter how big the sensor, how fast the AF, or what-have-you. For some situations you want some combination of sheer resolution plus max DOF. But for most others it's a matter of how a multitude of factors converge &ndash; portability, responsiveness, ISO, creamy gradations, etc., etc.</p>

Another reaction she had to <a href="Pix/Beaches_09/index.html">this</a> portfolio was indignation on behalf of some of the subjects that I was publishing their likenesses without explicit model releases (she not being aware of the relevant freedom-of-expression legislation and having no prior exposure to the concept of street photography). I fully sympathise and often spend hours putting my subjects on crash Photoshop diets or blemish control. I've discarded many an image to avoid embarrassing a subject. But the Achilles in my camp is even more powerful than the U.S. Constitution &ndash; it's none other than Time itself. One of my subjects was an attractive middle-aged woman when I took the picture, yet was very reluctant to appear in public in a certain candid pose, even though I'd already gone to quite a bit of trouble to compensate for any indignities inflicted by a less-than-flattering angle. But that was before five years of a remorseless siege by Tempus Non-Fugit. The last time she happened to look on the same image she was just gratified just to look so much younger.</p>

If I've learned anything about art in the past fifty years, it's that <i>your</i> selection of my best shots (if I could somehow get you to bother), and <i>my</i> selection of my best shots are not going to be even remotely close &ndash; let alone Joe Blow's next door.<br/><br/>

But then, a few days ago, I chanced to notice that I kept on singling out Gary McParland's landscapes for further attention, as they appeared on onexposure.com. Which led me to his <a href="http://1x.com/member/27064/gary-mcparland/">title page</a>, where I found that four or five images there really grab me by the short hairs. Yet, if I'd seen a random assortment of four or five of his images I most likely wouldn't have given them a second thought.<br/><br/>

This led me by turns to the idea of assembling my own flashiest, most accessible images in one place ... of course based on my own best guess as to which those are. So here ya go: The official <a href="Pix/HotShots1/index.html">DC Sampler 1: Landscapes</a> and <a href="Pix/HotShots1/index.html">DC Sampler 2: Soulscapes</a> are born. And if I've left out your favourite, well ply me with my <a href="http://www.creemoresprings.com/live/">favourite beer</a> (cool, not cold) and we just might be able to work something out... ;)</p>

<p class="LightBlueBoxWide"><b><a href="PixMain.html"><img src="Pix/Site/SlateBlueBox.jpg" width="9" height="9" alt="Site info" /></a> 02 Apr '10</b>: <b>Done</b>: I've finally finished overhauling all material on this site to conform with the new layout. So far no yelling, screaming, kicking, or holding of breath in protest of the changes. Once again: if you're not using a recent browser you're not seeing the new design in all its glory.</p>

<p class="LightBlueBoxWide"><b><a href="Pix/RMSampler/index.html"><img src="Pix/Site/Khaki.jpg" width="9" height="9" alt="Go to portfolio" /></a> 28 Mar '10</b>: When I started this site, the only content I had to work with was my own; now I have the luxury of a least a growing body of work by other artists to make use of. I've just added four new photographs to Bob Munro's <a href="Pix/RMSampler/index.html">portfolio</a> on this site, not the least of which appears above. What finally occurred to me is to feature the whole portfolio on the main page. So in future as new guest portfolios and additions to existing guest portfolios occur, I'll be taking advantage of that to give them a bit of time in the spotlight. If nothing else this gives you something different to look at when you come here.<br/><br/>

But further on Bob's portfolio: click on Seal Refuge above, which will take you to the portfolio, then you can either use your left arrow key to go directly to the four new additions to the portfolio, or the right arrow to go through the images in normal sequence.</p>

<p class="LightBlueBoxWide"><b><a href="Pix/RMSampler/index.html"><img src="Pix/Site/Khaki.jpg" width="9" height="9" alt="Go to portfolio" /></a> 28 Mar '10b: (qualified) request for new content</b>: I mention above that this site features portfolios and even one written article but other people. As much as I would like ever more such content, but have so far hesitated to openly solicit it. Being fairly thin-skinned myself, I can imagine someone sending me a link to his or her work only to have me reject it. Even though we all know this is more the walls of Joe's Diner than MoMA, rejection is rejection.<br/><br/>

So let's put it like this: I <b>do</b> solicit new content, but understand that the content needs to fit into the highly idiosyncratic gestalt of this site. Ultimately, it's only I that can decide whether something will fit; and if I take a pass on your offering, that should not be taken as a comment about merit but only about relevance. On the upside: all content by other contributors on this site is clearly marked as <b>copyrighted solely by the contributor</b> and its appearance on these pages gives me no claim to it in any way whatsoever.<br/><br/>

When it comes to visual art &ndash; and I'm equally open to paintings as well as photographs &ndash; while I would certainly enjoy having enough material from a given contributor for a portfolio, it occurs to me that there could be one or more portfolios featuring one or a few images each from multiple artists &ndash; the on-line equivalent of a <b>group show</b>. I find this idea exciting; maybe you do too. I can't off hand see how the same idea can be made to apply to written material, but if I'm missing the obvious by all means let me know.</p>

<p class="LightBlueBoxWide"><b><a href="PixMain.html"><img src="Pix/Site/SlateBlueBox.jpg" width="9" height="9" alt="Site info" /></a> 19 Mar '10</b>: <b>Heads up</b>: I've been working on the <a href="PixMain.html">portfolios</a> and checking the new design on my son's brand new 21" iMac. This computer applies a severe amount of over-sharpening (USM) to the entire screen, creating diabolical halos around details, resulting in a hideous granularity. If there's a system control for this on the iMac, I haven't been able to find it. Better monitors have a sharpness control buried in its on-screen menu system. It's very important both for general viewing and especially for image editing to set this to a neutral value.</p>

<p class="LightBlueBoxWide"><b><a href="Docs/Other/New2/index.html"><img src="Pix/Site/SlateBlueBox.jpg" width="9" height="9" alt="Go to site info" /></a> 12 Mar '10</b>: A heads-up and a plea to my readers: <a href="Docs/Other/New2/index.html">Site changes, spring 2010</a>. <b>Update</b> 15 Mar: As you can see, I've re-done the site pages using the new design. I've also re-done <a href="Pix/Masters/index.html">Some Masterpieces from the Public Domain</a> and will be plowing my way through the rest of this site's content in the weeks to come.</p>

<p class="LightBlueBoxWide"><b><a href="Pix/Masters/pg9.html"><img src="Pix/Site/Khaki.jpg" width="9" height="9" alt="Go to portfolio" /></a> 25 Feb '10</b>: Sorry: I've been at it again. Thought I was done with the Masterpieces project for a while, but then I discovered the Wikipedia Commons Botticelli's. So here are my <a href="Pix/Masters/pg9.html">restorations</a>, including some iconic images that few who frequent this site will fail to recognize.</p>

<p class="LightBlueBoxWide"><b><a href="Pix/Masters/pg1.html"><img src="Pix/Site/Khaki.jpg" width="9" height="9" alt="Go to portfolio" /></a> 07 Feb '10</b>: Long time since my last addition to this site, but I haven't been goofing off &ndash; honest! Instead, I've put in unnumbered hours working on a major upgrade to my unsung masterpiece, <a href="Pix/Masters/pg1.html">Some Masterpieces from the Public Domain</a> (which I should probably rename to Looting the Wikipedia Commons). I've now nearly doubled the number of painting reproductions available to 41, including a "new" Rembrandt, a page of miscellaneous paintings from the <a href="Pix/Masters/pg7.html">Rennaissance through the 1700s</a>, and a page on the <a href="Pix/Masters/pg8.html">Pre-Raphaelites</a> and other 19th century masters of realism. In all, a feast for the eyes.</p-->
