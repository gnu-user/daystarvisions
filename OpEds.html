<h2>The blind leading the blind: advice to beginning artists</h2>

<p><b>2 March 2009</b>: One of the most common phenomena on the web is the novice photographer posting a collection of JPEGs then asking for critical input in the stated hope of improving his craft (and the unstated hope of being discovered). 

<p>One problem with this approach is that the people who respond range in competence from the same novitiate level as the advice seeker to the muddle in the middle to sage, yet all of them write their responses with utter self assurance. If the advice seeker had the perspective to sort the wheat from the chaff, he wouldn't need their advice in the first place. Compounding this problem, those offering the most wrong-headed input are often the very ones with the most authoritative tone and the very ones who are most likely to drown out actual good advice in a flood of self-justification. 

<p>When it comes to technical advice &ndash; how to prevent blown highlights or how to eliminate camera shake &ndash; one at least has the option of trying all the solutions offered to discover which actually work. But when it comes to aesthetic advice, it's a whole other ballgame.

Contrary to popular belief, you can't do this by asking other people for their opinions. If you ask ten people for their opinions on one picture, you'll get eleven different reactions - art by committee is a doomed proposition. 

<p>Seeking aesthetic criticism is founded on a false premise: that there is such a thing as a "right" way to do art, much as there is a right way to drive a vehicle or a right way to slice bread. It assumes there is such a thing as a "good" composition and a "bad" composition; a "correct" crop and an "incorrect" crop; colours that "work" and colours that "don't work". The best one can hope for from such advice is to gain a reasonable competence at creating pictures that look like everyone else's pictures. If that's the height of your ambition, then by all means go for it.

<p>One can surely count the number of people with formal art training who are active in photography forums. One of the first things one learns as an art educator is to <i>not</i> impose one's own ideas of right and wrong, good and bad, on one's students. Developing young talent without forcing it into one's own mold is an exceedingly delicate task and requires uncommon perceptiveness. At a minimum the art educator, like the physician, strives to do no harm (and would that art critics had the similar ethic). But of course doing no harm is a very different thing from actually doing good, and the ratio of harmless to helpless in the world of art education is likely no better than what one might expect.

<p>So what are you the novice artist to do? It's actually not that difficult. What you need to do is simply to develop a sense for which of your pictures are true keepers. 

Instead, just keep taking lots of pictures. (I'm not saying don't show your pictures to others; just don't let their judgments override your own. )

<p>Let's say you've taken a thousand pictures up to now. At the moment you have your personal top ten. After you've taken another thousand pictures, some of them will bump some of your previous top ten off the list and your standards for what it takes for a picture to rank as a keeper will have become more stringent.

<p>You'll also learn that pictures you really liked for the first few weeks will lose their appeal fairly quickly; this is what I call the infatuation effect, so just letting a picture sit around for a few months is a critical part of the weeding-out process.

<p>When you have a set of pictures that have remained on your top ten or top twenty list for more than three or four years then you'll start to have a strong portfolio. In the meantime, just enjoy the ride!


<h2>A safe place to visit</h2>

 <p><b>29 July '08</b>: Here's one problem you don't have to worry about when you visit this site: <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080729.wrsecurity29/BNStory/Technology/home">Legitimate websites face new threats</a> (Globe & Mail). With barely 400 page views per day Daystar Visions is not a prime target for hackers. If you visit this site regularly, pat yourself on the back: you're a member of a <i>very</i> exclusive club. ;)
 
<p>The first requirement of art is that it pierce the heart like a stiletto. Too many photographers mistake a sharp tool for accurate aim; others believe irony, intellect, or alienation will suffice for their targets. But the measure is as simple as it is ruthless: no one may escape great art unscathed.

<h2>Symmetry</h2>

<p><b>Undated 2008</b>: A fascinating symmetry of the special theory of relativity is seldom commented on in popularizations but is the sort of thing that makes physicists wax lyrical.

<p>If you are observing on earth as I fly by in a space ship at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you observe the length of my ship and the duration of my transit and report it to me. Both measurements will be noticeably less than the ones I make of my own ship and my own transit time. But strangely the converse is true as well. If I observe the length of your observatory and how fast your assistant's Ferrari is traveling as he drives up the mountain on his way to work, and report these numbers to you, you will say they are both too short.

<p>It is said that people seldom suffer fools gladly. But in my experience the converse is equally true: fools seldom suffer wise men gladly. Fools believe their folly to be wisdom and the wise man's wisdom to be folly. This leaves us in the wonderful position of always being able to convince ourselves that we ourselves are the bearers of wisdom and that those who do not agree are fools. Never fail to take comfort from this observation &ndash; it may be the only comfort the universe will ever toss your way... ;)

<h2>Photo gear obsession</h2>

<p><b>Nov 2007</b>: You'll often read on forums that obsession with equipment in photography would be like painters getting together and arguing over which brand of paintbrush is superior. This sounds very deep but fails the test of history. The reason painters don't have equipment debates is because their technology came to maturity centuries ago. If we were to listen in on two rival painters arguing back in the Renaissance, however, the story would be very different.

<p>I watched a documentary on paint technology not too long ago; painters did not always have the palette of pigments available that we take for granted now. A painter that had access to something like pure ultramarine blue or vermilion when these pigments were just being perfected would have had a dramatic technical edge over the competition. The secrets of pigment and paint preparation were closely guarded and passed down from master to apprentice. 

<p>The trick is to have gear that meets your goals or goals that match your gear. Choose one.

<h2>Chip and Dale</h2>

<p><b>14 Jul '07</b>: He's so far defied my efforts to get a grab-shot, but a certain chipmunk (Chip to my Dale) has been feasting on the bird seed droppings from my bird feeder of late. He crams in as much as he can hold, then dashes with cheek pouches full to unload at his larder, then dashes back for more. I mention this because I'd like to get the shot of Chip with full cheek pouches to illustrate a concept. Namely, that the real reason we humans do this weird thing we call visual art is to hoard visual beauty when it's plentiful in order to have it around to enjoy when it's scarce. &ndash; Just another symptom of our hyper-enlarged visual cortex that we homo saps could value something as inedible as visual data to such a degree. Amazing isn't it? What will Mother Nature come up with next? A species that chooses a mate based on visual attributes or purchases food based on the attractiveness of its packaging or acquires vehicles based on their styling? ... Nah. No organism could be that contra-survival... 

<h2>Introducing guest artist Linda Shedlock</h2>

<p><b>(16 May 2007)</b>: This site averages about 300 visits per day, virtually all of them, I'm sure, photographers, and maybe half of those could well have no interest in art whatsoever (Hey - how does this DOF stuff work, again?). Those of you who do put art and photography in the same package may well do so because you have no interest whatsoever in all that weird stuff painters do to perfectly good pieces of paper or canvas. 

<p>If so, I think you'll be missing out on something special. Anyone who gets deeply involved doing art (including art photography) may have started out with the idea that it's to be just a hobby, a pastime, then gradually gotten hooked. You realize that has happened when you find yourself searching for your own "voice", your unique contribution to the visual microcosm. Ironically, in this case the more you press, the worse the results. The intellect is not the best tool by which to achieve this goal; almost by definition finding your artistic identity is something that has to grow as an organic extension of your total being.

<p>The first thing that struck me about the art of Linda Shedlock is that she has found her own voice. The other thing that's immediately obvious is that the voice she's found is a lyrical one.

<h2>Ansel lives!</h2>

<p><b>(14 Feb 2007)</b>: Breaking news! Ansel Adams, the iconic American landscape photographer long believed dead, is in fact still alive and residing incognito in a safe house near Boswell, New Mexico along with Elvis Aron Presley and a mysterious figure some believe to be Jimmy Hoffa, although this has not been confirmed. We coaxed Mr. Adams out of hiding last week to get his views on digital photography in general and the recent megapixel controversy in particular:

<p>&quot;Yes, it's true. I have been actively involved in photography through the digital revolution. I started with a 2.6 megapixel Nikon D1. Then I upgraded to a Nikon D2X when that model was released &ndash; but did not find the extra megapixels to be that important. I now shoot a special edition, titanium body, 4 megapixel Olympus C-4040, rigged with a custom-made accordion lens shade and a carbon fiber Velbon tripod, specially manufactured to my own specifications. I find this lightweight combination gives me exceptional image quality in prints up to 20x30 inches; and, in any case, everyone I show my work to seems to be able to tell the difference between Half Dome and the Grand Canyon, which of course is all that really matters.

<p>&quot;Having experimented with many tools, my digital 'darkroom' now consists of the very spartan combination of QImage and an Epson 9600 printer. Of course, I experimented with Photoshop and similar software in the beginning. But if there's one lesson I've learned over the years, it's that a good photographer gets the image right in the camera. Fussing about in post-processing is strictly for losers. [Chuckles] I remember how I used to spend hours dodging and burning every print under a dim red bulb in my darkroom &ndash; how embarrassing to look back on the follies of one's youth!&quot;

<h2>Gravel and grace</h2>

<p><b>Jan 2007</b>: I watched a bio of Louis Armstrong over the holidays. Louis did little more than teach the world how to make music. Before Louis music was a just-so-story, made in Europe by dead people. Exquisitely crafted, beautifully rendered ... with about as much vitality as a bed pan. 

<p>Photography seems to be in need of another Louis. Is there something in the Euro-Caucasian genome that prescribes this propensity for emulating zombies? I'm late to the party, but it seems to me that photography was beginning to jive a bit in the 1930s and '40s with the likes of <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/F/friedlander/friedlander_wade_wards_granddaughters_full.html">Friedlander</a> and <a href="http://www.masters-of-photography.com/W/winogrand/winogrand_worlds_fair_full.html">Winogrand</a>. Now, with the digital camera revolution married to the Internet revolution, there is a massive upswell of amateurs who can't seem to get past the four-square prissiness of static content, squeaky-clean detail, saturated but not garish colour, and studio-perfect lighting. 

<p>Is there no one left in photography who can understand why Louis had gravel in his voice, sang syllables that couldn't be found in any dictionary, and riffed cascades of notes that perpetually played tag with the down beat? What does the visual equivalent of that look like?

<p>What I'm talking about is different from art school experimentalism and university conceptualism. Europe recognized its own musical malaise at the same time Louis was waifing it in the streets of New Orleans. But the prescription Europe came up with was to push its head-tripping to new extremes: the dodecaphonic arythmia of Berg and Schoenberg. Art and intellect make uneasy bed-fellows; the offspring are most often alienation, neurosis, and despair. Jive shows us the way &ndash; not less in touch with the life force, but more.

<h2>The dark continent</h2>

<p><b>(Date unknown: 2006?)</b>: The more I learn about photography the more amazed I become at what a vast continent of different subject matter, equipment, approaches, techniques, passions, heroes, and much more it encompasses. The continent could in fact be the storied Africa of a few hundred years ago - easy to travel no farther than across the next river to find oneself in the territory of a completely alien tribe, speaking an incomprehensible language or dialect. Universal concepts like optics and exposure allow just enough communication between tribes to generate endless misunderstandings, which in turn generate the copious amounts of heat that give it the reputation for being such a sweltering place to live.

<br><br>On the continent of Photography it takes a very few days to cross through the territory of tribes like the MacroInsectophiles to the neighbouring AvianTelephotophiles ending up at the ViewCamera Foothills, inhabited by the gently nomadic B'n'UUs. Crossing that chain, then fording the treacherous DigitalVersusFilm Rapids, might bring us to the wild hordes of Canon-worshipping, white-lensed ProPhotoJournalistici and ProSportsPhotographici, perennially waging a war of extermination against the black-barrelled Nikon Heresiacs. A treacherous journey this, with either clan spelling almost certain death to a lone traveler armed only with a single lens, manual-action Hexar.

<h2>Poetry in the visual arts</h2>

<p><b>(Date unknown: 2005?)</b>: I recently saw the following quote in an art store:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="navy">"Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- L. Da Vinci</font>

<br><br>This sums up most everything I know about art. If I had come across this quote a few years ago I would have agreed with it then too. But there are levels of agreement. It is easy to agree with Sherman that "war is hell", but I assume these words take on a whole new level of meaning for someone who has actually been on the receiving end of a bombardment. Similarly, after you've painted your first 100 pictures or made your first 1000 photographs, you will see that some thrive while others wilt on the vine. If you look for the common element in the ones that thrive you begin to latch on to the essence of the above quote as if seeing a vague shape looming in a fog that gradually clarifies as you move closer to it. 

<br><br>Surely [visual] art could be taught with a graduated series of koans like the above. "OK: you understand what Picasso meant when he said that 'to paint from nature is to draw toenails'. Good: next work on what Robert Capa meant when he said 'if your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough.'"

<h2>Art and love</h2>

<p><b>(Date unknown: 2004?)</b>: The more I make pictures the clearer I get about what's going on. I was just sitting on my deck - almost overcast evening sky, green plague trees receding into the distance. A small dark bird came darting into the scene, drilling a hole into the sky, then disappearing over the horizon. I'm part bird myself; my heart went out to the little guy, busy on some mission that consumed his soul. Love is the bridge that binds us to the higher plane we yearn for. 

<br><br>For, as a lens is to a camera, so a photographer is to the world. The artist participates in - not witnesses - the creation of the scene she or he renders. Where there is love to bridge the gap between artist and subject, there is always the possibility of the resulting image arcing that second gap between artist and viewer. The viewer knows love, the artist knows love, the only question is: can the artist trigger the love response in the viewer for the subject of the image? All our efforts and artifices are directed toward this end.

<h2>The clock is ticking</h2>

<p><b>(Date unknown: 2004?)</b>: Thanks to all the benefits of modern civilization, the average person will live about 70 years or 2,209,032,000 seconds. About 2/3s of these are committed to sleeping, eating, and bread-winning. We have found various uses for the remaining 736,344,000 seconds, of which channel surfing remains by far the most popular. But, if you should ever burn out on re-runs, sitcoms, and reality shows, consider doing art. Lack talent? Not a problem: take up photography - no drawing or painting skills required. Lack imagination? Not a problem: let Mother Nature be your guide.
